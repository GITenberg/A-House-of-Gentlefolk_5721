    <h2>
      Chapter I
    </h2>
    <p>
      A bright spring day was fading into evening. High overhead in the clear
      heavens small rosy clouds seemed hardly to move across the sky but to be
      sinking into its depths of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a handsome house in one of the outlying streets of the government town
      of O&mdash;&mdash; (it was in the year 1842) two women were sitting at an
      open window; one was about fifty, the other an old lady of seventy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the former was Marya Dmitrievna Kalitin. Her husband, a shrewd
      determined man of obstinate bilious temperament, had been dead for ten
      years. He had been a provincial public prosecutor, noted in his own day as
      a successful man of business. He had received a fair education and had
      been to the university; but having been born in narrow circumstances he
      realized early in life the necessity of pushing his own way in the world
      and making money. It had been a love-match on Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s side. He
      was not bad-looking, was clever and could be very agreeable when he chose.
      Marya Dmitrievna Pesto&mdash;that was her maiden name&mdash;had lost her
      parents in childhood. She spent some years in a boarding-school in Moscow,
      and after leaving school, lived on the family estate of Pokrovskoe, about
      forty miles from O&mdash;&mdash;, with her aunt and her elder brother.
      This brother soon after obtained a post in Petersburg, and made them a
      scanty allowance. He treated his aunt and sister very shabbily till his
      sudden death cut short his career. Marya Dmitrievna inherited Pokrovskoe,
      but she did not live there long. Two years after her marriage with
      Kalitin, who succeeded in winning her heart in a few days, Pokrovskoe was
      exchanged for another estate, which yielded a much larger income, but was
      utterly unattractive and had no house. At the same time Kalitin took a
      house in the town of O&mdash;&mdash;, in which he and his wife took up
      their permanent abode. There was a large garden round the house, which on
      one side looked out upon the open country away from the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; decided Kalitin, who had a great distaste for the quiet of
      country life, &ldquo;there would be no need for them to be dragging themselves
      off into the country.&rdquo; In her heart Marya Dmitrievna more than once
      regretted her pretty Pokrovskoe, with its babbling brook, its wide
      meadows, and green copses; but she never opposed her husband in anything
      and had the greatest veneration for his wisdom and knowledge of the world.
      When after fifteen years of married life he died leaving her with a son
      and two daughters, Marya Dmitrievna had grown so accustomed to her house
      and to town life that she had no inclination to leave O&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her youth Marya Dmitrievna had always been spoken of as a pretty
      blonde; and at fifty her features had not lost all charm, though they were
      somewhat coarser and less delicate in outline. She was more sentimental
      than kindhearted; and even at her mature age, she retained the manners of
      the boarding-school. She was self-indulgent and easily put out, even moved
      to tears when she was crossed in any of her habits. She was, however, very
      sweet and agreeable when all her wishes were carried out and none opposed
      her. Her house was among the pleasantest in the town. She had a
      considerable fortune, not so much from her own property as from her
      husband&rsquo;s savings. Her two daughters were living with her; her son was
      being educated in one of the best government schools in Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady sitting with Marya Dmitrievna at the window was her father&rsquo;s
      sister, the same aunt with whom she had once spent some solitary years in
      Pokrovskoe. Her name was Marfa Timofyevna Pestov. She had a reputation for
      eccentricity as she was a woman of an independent character, told every
      one the truth to his face, and even in the most straitened circumstances
      behaved just as if she had a fortune at her disposal. She could not endure
      Kalitin, and directly her niece married him, she removed to her little
      property, where for ten whole years she lived in a smoky peasants&rsquo; hut.
      Marya Dmitrievna was a little afraid of her. A little sharp-nosed woman
      with black hair and keen eyes even in her old age, Marfa Timofyevna walked
      briskly, held herself upright and spoke quickly and clearly in a sharp
      ringing voice. She always wore a white cap and a white dressing-jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; she asked Marya Dmitrievna suddenly. &ldquo;What
      are you sighing about, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the latter. &ldquo;What exquisite clouds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel sorry for them, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it Gedeonovsky does not come?&rdquo; observed Marfa Timofyevna, moving
      her knitting needles quickly. (She was knitting a large woolen scarf.) &ldquo;He
      would have sighed with you&mdash;or at least he&rsquo;d have had some fib to
      tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How hard you always are on him! Sergei Petrovitch is a worthy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy!&rdquo; repeated the old lady scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how devoted he was to my poor husband!&rdquo; observed Marya Dmitrievna;
      &ldquo;even now he cannot speak of him without emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no wonder! It was he who picked him out of the gutter,&rdquo; muttered
      Marfa Timofyevna, and her knitting needles moved faster than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks so meek and mild,&rdquo; she began again, &ldquo;with his grey head, but he
      no sooner opens his mouth than out comes a lie or a slander. And to think
      of his having the rank of a councillor! To be sure, though, he&rsquo;s only a
      village priest&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one has faults, auntie; that is his weak point, no doubt. Sergei
      Petrovitch has had no education: of course he does not speak French,
      still, say what you like, he is an agreeable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is always ready to kiss your hands. He does not speak French&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      no great loss. I am not over strong in the French lingo myself. It would
      be better if he could not speak at all; he would not tell lies then. But
      here he is&mdash;speak of the devil,&rdquo; added Marfa Timofyevna looking into
      the street. &ldquo;Here comes your agreeable man striding along. What a lanky
      creature he is, just like a stork!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna began to arrange her curls. Marfa Timofyevna looked at
      her ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, not a grey hair surely? You must speak to your Palashka,
      what can she be thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, auntie, you are always so...&rdquo; muttered Marya Dmitrievna in a tone
      of vexation, drumming on the arm of her chair with her finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergei Petrovitch Gedeonovsky!&rdquo; was announced in a shrill piping voice,
      by a rosy-cheeked little page who made his appearance at the door.

      Chapter II
    </h2>
    <p>
      A tall man entered, wearing a tidy overcoat, rather short trousers, grey
      doeskin gloves, and two neckties&mdash;a black one outside, and a white
      one below it. There was an air of decorum and propriety in everything
      about him, from his prosperous countenance and smoothly brushed hair, to
      his low-heeled, noiseless boots. He bowed first to the lady of the house,
      then to Marfa Timofyevna, and slowly drawing off his gloves, he advanced
      to take Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s hand. After kissing it respectfully twice he
      seated himself with deliberation in an arm-chair, and rubbing the very
      tips of his fingers together, he observed with a smile&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is Elisaveta Mihalovna quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Elena Mihalovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lenotchka&rsquo;s in the garden too. Is there no news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is indeed!&rdquo; replied the visitor, slowly blinking his eyes and
      pursing up his mouth. &ldquo;Hm!... yes, indeed, there is a piece of news, and
      very surprising news too. Lavretsky&mdash;Fedor Ivanitch is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fedya!&rdquo; cried Marfa Timofyevna. &ldquo;Are you sure you are not romancing, my
      good man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I saw him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that does not prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fedor Ivanitch looked much more robust,&rdquo; continued Gedeonovsky, affecting
      not to have heard Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s last remark. &ldquo;Fedor Ivanitch is
      broader and has quite a colour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked more robust,&rdquo; said Marya Dmitrievna, dwelling on each syllable.
      &ldquo;I should have thought he had little enough to make him look robust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; observed Gedeonovsky; &ldquo;any other man in Fedor Ivanitch&rsquo;s
      position would have hesitated to appear in society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, pray?&rdquo; interposed Marfa Timofyevna. &ldquo;What nonsense are you
      talking! The man&rsquo;s come back to his home&mdash;where would you have him
      go? And has he been to blame, I should like to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The husband is always to blame, madam, I venture to assure you, when a
      wife misconducts herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that, my good sir, because you have never been married yourself.&rdquo;
       Gedeonovsky listened with a forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may be so inquisitive,&rdquo; he asked, after a short pause, &ldquo;for whom is
      that pretty scarf intended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna gave him a sharp look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s intended,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for a man who does not talk scandal, nor
      play the hypocrite, nor tell lies, if there&rsquo;s such a man to be found in
      the world. I know Fedya well; he was only to blame in being too good to
      his wife. To be sure, he married for love, and no good ever comes of those
      love-matches,&rdquo; added the old lady, with a sidelong glance at Marya
      Dmitrievna, as she got up from her place. &ldquo;And now, my good sir, you may
      attack any one you like, even me if you choose; I&rsquo;m going. I will not
      hinder you.&rdquo; And Marfa Timofyevna walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s always how she is,&rdquo; said Marya Dmitrievna, following her aunt with
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must remember your aunt&rsquo;s age...there&rsquo;s no help for it,&rdquo; replied
      Gedeonovsky. &ldquo;She spoke of a man not playing the hypocrite. But who is not
      hypocritical nowadays? It&rsquo;s the age we live in. One of my friends, a most
      worthy man, and, I assure you, a man of no mean position, used to say,
      that nowadays the very hens can&rsquo;t pick up a grain of corn without
      hypocrisy&mdash;they always approach it from one side. But when I look at
      you, dear lady&mdash;your character is so truly angelic; let me kiss your
      little snow-white hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna with a faint smile held out her plump hand to him with
      the little finger held apart from the rest. He pressed his lips to it, and
      she drew her chair nearer to him, and bending a little towards him, asked
      in an undertone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you saw him? Was he really&mdash;all right&mdash;quite well and
      cheerful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was well and cheerful,&rdquo; replied Gedeonovsky in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard where his wife is now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was lately in Paris; now, they say, she has gone away to Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is terrible, indeed&mdash;Fedya&rsquo;s position; I wonder how he can bear
      it. Every one, of course, has trouble; but he, one may say, has been made
      the talk of all Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gedeonovsky sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, yes, indeed. They do say, you know that she associates with
      artists and musicians, and as the saying is, with strange creatures of all
      kinds. She has lost all sense of shame completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am deeply, deeply grieved.&rdquo; said Marya Dmitrievna. &ldquo;On account of our
      relationship. You know, Sergei Petrovitch, he&rsquo;s my cousin many times
      removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course. Don&rsquo;t I know everything that concerns your family?
      I should hope so, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he come to see us&mdash;what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would suppose so; though, they say, he is intending to go home to his
      country place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Dmitrievna lifted her eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Sergei Petrovitch, Sergei Petrovitch, when I think how careful we
      women ought to be in our conduct!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are women and women, Marya Dmitrievna. There are unhappily such ...
      of flighty character... and at a certain age too, and then they are not
      brought up in good principles.&rdquo; (Sergei Petrovitch drew a blue checked
      handkerchief out of his pocket and began to unfold it.) &ldquo;There are such
      women, no doubt.&rdquo; (Sergei Petrovitch applied a corner of the handkerchief
      first to one and then to the other eye.) &ldquo;But speaking generally, if one
      takes into consideration, I mean...the dust in the town is really
      extraordinary to-day,&rdquo; he wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maman, maman,&rdquo; cried a pretty little girl of eleven running into the
      room, &ldquo;Vladimir Nikolaitch is coming on horseback!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna got up; Sergei Petrovitch also rose and made a bow. &ldquo;Our
      humble respects to Elena Mihalovna,&rdquo; he said, and turning aside into a
      corner for good manners, he began blowing his long straight nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a splendid horse he has!&rdquo; continued the little girl. &ldquo;He was at the
      gate just now, he told Lisa and me he would dismount at the steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of hoofs was heard; and a graceful young man, riding a beautiful
      bay horse, was seen in the street, and stopped at the open window.

      &ldquo;How do you do, Marya Dmitrievna?&rdquo; cried the young man in a pleasant,
      ringing voice. &ldquo;How do you like my new purchase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna went up to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Woldemar! Ah, what a splendid horse! Where did you buy
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought it from the army contractor.... He made me pay for it too, the
      brigand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s its name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orlando.... But it&rsquo;s a stupid name; I want to change.... Eh bien, eh
      bien, mon garcon.... What a restless beast it is!&rdquo; The horse snorted,
      pawed the ground, and shook the foam off the bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lenotchka, stroke him, don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl stretched her hand out of the window, but Orlando suddenly
      reared and started. The rider with perfect self-possession gave it a cut
      with the whip across the neck, and keeping a tight grip with his legs
      forced it in spite of its opposition, to stand still again at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prenez garde, prenez garde,&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna kept repeating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lenotchka, pat him,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let him be perverse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl again stretched out her hand and timidly patted the
      quivering nostrils of the horse, who kept fidgeting and champing the bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;but now get off and come in to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rider adroitly turned his horse, gave him a touch of the spur, and
      galloping down the street soon reached the courtyard. A minute later he
      ran into the drawing-room by the door from the hall, flourishing his whip;
      at the same moment there appeared in the other doorway a tall, slender
      dark-haired girl of nineteen, Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s eldest daughter, Lisa.

    <h2>
      Chapter IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The name of the young man whom we have just introduced to the reader was
      Vladimir Nikolaitch Panshin. He served in Petersburg on special
      commissions in the department of internal affairs. He had come to the town
      of O&mdash;&mdash; to carry out some temporary government commissions, and
      was in attendance on the Governor-General Zonnenberg, to whom he happened
      to be distantly related. Panshin&rsquo;s father, a retired cavalry officer and a
      notorious gambler, was a man with insinuating eyes, a battered
      countenance, and a nervous twitch about the mouth. He spent his whole life
      hanging about the aristocratic world; frequented the English clubs of both
      capitals, and had the reputation of a smart, not very trustworthy, but
      jolly good-natured fellow. In spite of his smartness, he was almost always
      on the brink of ruin, and the property he left his son was small and
      heavily-encumbered. To make up for that, however, he did exert himself,
      after his own fashion, over his son&rsquo;s education. Vladimir Nikolaitch spoke
      French very well, English well, and German badly; that is the proper
      thing; fashionable people would be ashamed to speak German well; but to
      utter an occasional&mdash;generally a humorous&mdash;phrase in German is
      quite correct, c&rsquo;est meme tres chic, as the Parisians of Petersburg
      express themselves. By the time he was fifteen, Vladimir knew how to enter
      any drawing-room without embarrassment, how to move about in it gracefully
      and to leave it at the appropriate moment. Panshin&rsquo;s father gained many
      connections for his son. He never lost an opportunity, while shuffling the
      cards between two rubbers, or playing a successful trump, of dropping a
      hint about his Volodka to any personage of importance who was a devotee of
      cards. And Vladimir, too, during his residence at the university, which he
      left without a very brilliant degree, formed an acquaintance with several
      young men of quality, and gained an entry into the best houses. He was
      received cordially everywhere: he was very good-looking, easy in his
      manners, amusing, always in good health, and ready for everything;
      respectful, when he ought to be; insolent, when he dared to be; excellent
      company, un charmant garcon. The promised land lay before him. Panshin
      quickly learnt the secret of getting on in the world; he knew how to yield
      with genuine respect to its decrees; he knew how to take up trifles with
      half ironical seriousness, and to appear to regard everything serious as
      trifling; he was a capital dancer; and dressed in the English style. In a
      short time he gained the reputation of being one of the smartest and most
      attractive young men in Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panshin was indeed very smart, not less so than his father; but he was
      also very talented. He did everything well; he sang charmingly, sketched
      with spirit, wrote verses, and was a very fair actor. He was only
      twenty-eight, and he was already a kammer-yunker, and had a very good
      position. Panshin had complete confidence in himself, in his own
      intelligence, and his own penetration; he made his way with light-hearted
      assurance, everything went smoothly with him. He was used to being liked
      by every one, old and young, and imagined that he understood people,
      especially women: he certainly understood their ordinary weaknesses. As a
      man of artistic leanings, he was conscious of a capacity for passion, for
      being carried away, even for enthusiasm, and consequently, he permitted
      himself various irregularities; he was dissipated, associated with persons
      not belonging to good society, and, in general, conducted himself in a
      free and easy manner; but at heart he was cold and false, and at the
      moment of the most boisterous revelry his sharp brown eye was always
      alert, taking everything in. This bold, independent young man could never
      forget himself and be completely carried away. To his credit it must be
      said, that he never boasted of his conquests. He had found his way into
      Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s house immediately he arrived in O&mdash;&mdash;, and
      was soon perfectly at home there. Marya Dmitrievna absolutely adored him.
      Panshin exchanged cordial greetings with every one in the room; he shook
      hands with Marya Dmitrievna and Lisaveta Mihalovna, clapped Gedeonovsky
      lightly on the shoulder, and turning round on his heels, put his hand on
      Lenotchka&rsquo;s head and kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid to ride such a vicious horse?&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna
      questioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you he&rsquo;s very quiet, but I will tell you what I am afraid of:
      I&rsquo;m afraid to play preference with Sergei Petrovitch; yesterday he cleaned
      me out of everything at Madame Byelenitsin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gedeonovsky gave a thin, sympathetic little laugh; he was anxious to be in
      favour with the brilliant young official from Petersburg&mdash;the
      governor&rsquo;s favourite. In conversation with Marya Dmitrievna, he often
      alluded to Panshin&rsquo;s remarkable abilities. Indeed, he used to argue, how
      can one help admiring him? The young man is making his way in the highest
      spheres, he is an exemplary official, and not a bit of pride about him.
      And, in fact, even in Petersburg Panshin was reckoned a capable official;
      he got through a great deal of work; he spoke of it lightly as befits a
      man of the world who does not attach any special importance to his
      labours, but he never hesitated in carrying out orders. The authorities
      like such subordinates; he himself had no doubt, that if he chose, he
      could be a minister in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pleased to say that I cleaned you out,&rdquo; replied Gedeonovsky; &ldquo;but
      who was it won twelve roubles of me last week and more?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a malicious fellow,&rdquo; Panshin interrupted, with genial but somewhat
      contemptuous carelessness, and, paying him no further attention, he went
      up to Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot get the overture of Oberon here,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Madame Byelenitsin
      was boasting when she said she had all the classical music: in reality she
      has nothing but polkas and waltzes, but I have already written to Moscow,
      and within a week you will have the overture. By the way,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I
      wrote a new song yesterday, the words too are mine, would you care for me
      to sing it? I don&rsquo;t know how far it is successful. Madame Byelenitsin
      thought it very pretty, but her words mean nothing. I should like to know
      what you think of it. But, I think, though, that had better be later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why later on?&rdquo; interposed Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;why not now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obey,&rdquo; replied Panshin, with a peculiar bright and sweet smile, which
      came and went suddenly on his face. He drew up a chair with his knee, sat
      down to the piano, and striking a few chords began to sing, articulating
      the words clearly, the following song&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Above the earth the moon floats high
            Amid pale clouds;
        Its magic light in that far sky
            Yet stirs the floods.

        My heart has found a moon to rule
            Its stormy sea;
        To joy and sorrow it is moved
            Only by thee.

        My soul is full of love&rsquo;s cruel smart,
            And longing vain;
        But thou art calm, as that cold moon,
            That knows not pain.
</pre>
    <p>
      The second couplet was sung by Panshin with special power and expression,
      the sound of waves was heard in the stormy accompaniment. After the words
      &ldquo;and longing vain,&rdquo; he sighed softly, dropped his eyes and let his voice
      gradually die away, morendo. When he had finished, Lisa praised the
      motive, Marya Dmitrievna cried, &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; but Gedeonovsky went so far as
      to exclaim, &ldquo;Ravishing poetry, and music equally ravishing!&rdquo; Lenotchka
      looked with childish reverence at the singer. In short, every one present
      was delighted with the young dilettante&rsquo;s composition; but at the door
      leading into the drawing-room from the hall stood an old man, who had only
      just come in, and who, to judge by the expression of his downcast face and
      the shrug of his shoulders, was by no means pleased with Panshin&rsquo;s song,
      pretty though it was. After waiting a moment and flicking the dust off his
      boots with a coarse pocket-handkerchief, this man suddenly raised his
      eyes, compressed his lips with a morose expression, and his stooping
      figure bent forward, he entered the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Christopher Fedoritch, how are you?&rdquo; exclaimed Panshin before any of
      the others could speak, and he jumped up quickly from his seat. &ldquo;I had no
      suspicion that you were here&mdash;nothing would have induced me to sing
      my song before you. I know you are no lover of light music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hear it,&rdquo; declared the new-comer, in very bad Russian, and
      exchanging greetings with every one, he stood awkwardly in the middle of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come, Monsieur Lemm,&rdquo; said Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;to give Lisa her
      music lesson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not Lisaveta Mihalovna, but Elena Mihalovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well. Lenotchka, go up-stairs with Mr. Lemm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was about to follow the little girl, but Panshin stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go after the lesson, Christopher Fedoritch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lisa
      Mihalovna and I are going to play a duet of Beethoven&rsquo;s sonata.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man muttered some reply, and Panshin continued in German,
      mispronouncing the words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisaveta Mihalovna showed me the religious cantata you dedicated to her&mdash;a
      beautiful thing! Pray, do not suppose that I cannot appreciate serious
      music&mdash;quite the contrary: it is tedious sometimes, but then it is
      very elevating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man crimsoned to his ears, and with a sidelong look at Lisa, he
      hurriedly went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna asked Panshin to sing his song again; but he protested
      that he did not wish to torture the ears of the musical German, and
      suggested to Lisa that they should attack Beethoven&rsquo;s sonata. Then Marya
      Dmitrievna heaved a sigh, and in her turn suggested to Gedeonovsky a walk
      in the garden. &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have a little more talk, and
      to consult you about our poor Fedya.&rdquo; Gedeonovsky bowed with a smirk, and
      with two fingers picked up his hat, on the brim of which his gloves had
      been tidily laid, and went away with Marya Dmitrievna. Panshin and Lisa
      remained alone in the room; she fetched the sonata, and opened it; both
      seated themselves at the piano in silence. Overhead were heard the faint
      sounds of scales, played by the uncertain fingers of Lenotchka.

    <h2>
      Chapter V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christopher Theodor Gottlieb Lemm was born in 1786 in the town of Chemnitz
      in Saxony. His parents were poor musicians. His father played the French
      horn, his mother the harp; he himself was practising on three different
      instruments by the time he was five. At eight years old he was left an
      orphan, and from his tenth year he began to earn his bread by his art. He
      led a wandering life for many years, and performed everywhere in
      restaurants, at fairs, at peasants&rsquo; weddings, and at balls. At last he got
      into an orchestra and constantly rising in it, he obtained the position of
      director. He was rather a poor performer; but he understood music
      thoroughly. At twenty-eight he migrated into Russia, on the invitation of
      a great nobleman, who did not care for music himself, but kept an
      orchestra for show. Lemm lived with him seven years in the capacity of
      orchestra conductor, and left him empty-handed. The nobleman was ruined,
      he intended to give him a promissory note, but in the sequel refused him
      even that&mdash;in short, did not pay him a farthing. He was advised to go
      away; but he was unwilling to return home in poverty from Russia, that
      great Russia which is a mine of gold for artists; he decided to remain and
      try his luck. For twenty years the poor German had been trying his luck;
      he had lived in various gentlemen&rsquo;s houses, had suffered and put up with
      much, had faced privation, had struggled like a fish on the ice; but the
      idea of returning to his own country never left him among all the
      hardships he endured; it was this dream alone that sustained him. But fate
      did not see fit to grant him this last and first happiness: at fifty,
      broken-down in health and prematurely aged, he drifted to the town of O&mdash;&mdash;,
      and remained there for good, having now lost once for all every hope of
      leaving Russia, which he detested. He gained his poor livelihood somehow
      by lessons. Lemm&rsquo;s exterior was not prepossessing. He was short and bent,
      with crooked shoulders, and contracted chest, with large flat feet, and
      bluish white nails on the gnarled bony fingers of his sinewy red hands. He
      had a wrinkled face, sunken cheeks, and compressed lips, which he was for
      ever twitching and biting; and this, together with his habitual
      taciturnity, produced an impression almost sinister. His grey hair hung in
      tufts on his low brow; like smouldering embers, his little set eyes glowed
      with dull fire. He moved painfully, at every step swinging his ungainly
      body forward. Some of his movements recalled the clumsy actions of an owl
      in a cage when it feels that it is being looked at, but itself can hardly
      see out of its great yellow eyes timorously and drowsily blinking.
      Pitiless, prolonged sorrow had laid its indelible stamp on the poor
      musician; it had disfigured and deformed his person, by no means
      attractive to begin with. But any one who was able to get over the first
      impression would have discerned something good, and honest, and out of the
      common in this half-shattered creature. A devoted admirer of Bach and
      Handel, a master of his art, gifted with a lively imagination and that
      boldness of conception which is only vouchsafed to the German race, Lemm
      might, in time&mdash;who knows?&mdash;have taken rank with the great
      composers of his fatherland, had his life been different; but he was born
      under an unlucky star! He had written much in his life, and it had not
      been granted to him to see one of his compositions produced; he did not
      know how to set about things in the right way, to gain favour in the right
      place, and to make a push at the right moment. A long, long time ago, his
      one friend and admirer, also a German and also poor, had published two of
      Lemm&rsquo;s sonatas at his own expense&mdash;the whole edition remained on the
      shelves of the music-shops; they disappeared without a trace, as though
      they had been thrown into a river by night. At last Lemm had renounced
      everything; the years too did their work; his mind had grown hard and
      stiff, as his fingers had stiffened. He lived alone in a little cottage
      not far from the Kalitin&rsquo;s house, with an old cook he had taken out of the
      poorhouse (he had never married). He took long walks, and read the Bible
      and the Protestant version of the Psalms, and Shakespeare in Schlegel&rsquo;s
      translation. He had composed nothing for a long time; but apparently,
      Lisa, his best pupil, had been able to inspire him; he had written for her
      the cantata to which Panshin had! made allusion. The words of this cantata
      he had borrowed from his collection of hymns. He had added a few verses of
      his own. It was sung by two choruses&mdash;a chorus of the happy and a
      chorus of the unhappy. The two were brought into harmony at the end, and
      sang together, &ldquo;Merciful God, have pity on us sinners, and deliver us from
      all evil thoughts and earthly hopes.&rdquo; On the title-page was the
      inscription, most carefully written and even illuminated, &ldquo;Only the
      righteous are justified. A religious cantata. Composed and dedicated to
      Miss Elisaveta Kalitin, his dear pupil, by her teacher, C. T. G. Lemm.&rdquo;
       The words, &ldquo;Only the righteous are justified&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elisaveta Kalitin,&rdquo;
       were encircled by rays. Below was written: &ldquo;For you alone, fur Sie
      allein.&rdquo; This was why Lemm had grown red, and looked reproachfully at
      Lisa; he was deeply wounded when Panshin spoke of his cantata before him.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Panshin, who was playing bass, struck the first chords of the sonata
      loudly and decisively, but Lisa did not begin her part. He stopped and
      looked at her. Lisa&rsquo;s eyes were fixed directly on him, and expressed
      displeasure. There was no smile on her lips, her whole face looked stern
      and even mournful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not keep your word?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I showed you Christopher
      Fedoritch&rsquo;s cantata on the express condition that you said nothing about
      it to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Lisaveta Mihalovna, the words slipped out unawares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have hurt his feelings and mine too. Now he will not trust even me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I help it, Lisaveta Mihalovna? Ever since I was a little boy I
      could never see a German without wanting to teaze him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that, Vladimir Nikolaitch? This German is poor, lonely,
      and broken-down&mdash;have you no pity for him? Can you wish to teaze
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panshin was a little taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Lisaveta Mihalovna,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my everlasting
      thoughtlessness that&rsquo;s to blame. No, don&rsquo;t contradict me; I know myself.
      So much harm has come to me from my want of thought. It&rsquo;s owing to that
      failing that I am thought to be an egoist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panshin paused. With whatever subject he began a conversation, he
      generally ended by talking of himself, and the subject was changed by him
      so easily, so smoothly and genially, that it seemed unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your own household, for instance,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;your mother certainly
      wishes me well, she is so kind; you&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know your opinion
      of me; but on the other hand your aunt simply can&rsquo;t bear me. I must have
      offended her too by some thoughtless, stupid speech. You know I&rsquo;m not a
      favourite of hers, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lisa admitted with some reluctance, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panshin ran his fingers quickly over the keys, and a scarcely perceptible
      smile glided over his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and you?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you too think me an egoist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you very little,&rdquo; replied Lisa, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t consider you an
      egoist; on the contrary, I can&rsquo;t help feeling grateful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know what you mean to say,&rdquo; Panshin interrupted, and again he
      ran his fingers over the keys: &ldquo;for the music and the books I bring you,
      for the wretched sketches with which I adorn your album, and so forth. I
      might do all that&mdash;and be an egoist all the same. I venture to think
      that you don&rsquo;t find me a bore, and don&rsquo;t think me a bad fellow, but still
      you suppose that I&mdash;what&rsquo;s the saying?&mdash;would sacrifice friend
      or father for the sake of a witticism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are careless and forgetful, like all men of the world,&rdquo; observed
      Lisa, &ldquo;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panshin frowned a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us discuss me any more; let us play our
      sonata. There&rsquo;s only one thing I must beg of you,&rdquo; he added, smoothing out
      the leaves of the book on the music stand, &ldquo;think what you like of me,
      call me an egoist even&mdash;so be it! but don&rsquo;t call me a man of the
      world; that name&rsquo;s insufferable to me.... Anch &lsquo;io sono pittore. I too am
      an artist, though a poor one&mdash;and that&mdash;I mean that I&rsquo;m a poor
      artist, I shall show directly. Let us begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let us begin,&rdquo; said Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first adagio went fairly successfully though Panshin made more than
      one false note. His own compositions and what he had practised thoroughly
      he played very nicely, but he played at sight badly. So the second part of
      the sonata&mdash;a rather quick allegro&mdash;broke down completely; at
      the twentieth bar, Panshin, who was two bars behind, gave in, and pushed
      his chair back with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play to-day; it&rsquo;s a good thing Lemm did not hear
      us; he would have had a fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa got up, shut the piano, and turned round to Panshin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you, that question! You can never sit with your hands
      idle. Well, if you like let us sketch, since it&rsquo;s not quite dark. Perhaps
      the other muse, the muse of painting&mdash;what was her name? I have
      forgotten... will be more propitious to me. Where&rsquo;s your album? I
      remember, my landscape there is not finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa went into the other room to fetch the album, and Panshin, left alone,
      drew a cambric handkerchief out of his pocket, and rubbed his nails and
      looked as it were critically at his hands. He had beautiful white hands;
      on the second finger of his left hand he wore a spiral gold ring. Lisa
      came back; Panshin sat down at the window, and opened the album.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed: &ldquo;I see that you have begun to copy my landscape&mdash;and
      capitally too. Excellent! only just here&mdash;give me a pencil&mdash;the
      shadows are not put in strongly enough. Look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Panshin with a flourish added a few long strokes. He was for ever
      drawing the same landscape: in the foreground large disheveled trees, a
      stretch of meadow in the background, and jagged mountains on the horizon.
      Lisa looked over his shoulders at his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In drawing, just as in life generally,&rdquo; observed Panshin, holding his
      head to right and to left, &ldquo;lightness and boldness&mdash;are the great
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Lemm came into the room, and with a stiff bow was about to
      leave it; but Panshin, throwing aside album and pencils, placed himself in
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you doing, dear Christopher Fedoritch? Aren&rsquo;t you going to stay
      and have tea with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go home,&rdquo; answered Lemm in a surly voice; &ldquo;my head aches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what nonsense!&mdash;do stop. We&rsquo;ll have an argument about
      Shakespeare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head aches,&rdquo; repeated the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We set to work on the sonata of Beethoven without you,&rdquo; continued
      Panshin, taking hold of him affectionately and smiling brightly, &ldquo;but we
      couldn&rsquo;t get on at all. Fancy, I couldn&rsquo;t play two notes together
      correctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have sung your song again,&rdquo; replied Lemm, removing Panshin&rsquo;s
      hands, and he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa ran after him. She overtook him on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher Fedoritch, I want to tell you,&rdquo; she said to him in German,
      accompanying him over the short green grass of the yard to the gate, &ldquo;I
      did wrong&mdash;forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I showed Vladimir Nikolaitch your cantata; I felt sure he would
      appreciate it,&mdash;and he did like it very much really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter,&rdquo; he said in Russian, and then added in his own language,
      &ldquo;but he cannot understand anything; how is it you don&rsquo;t see that? He&rsquo;s a
      dilettante&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unjust to him,&rdquo; replied Lisa, &ldquo;he understands everything, and he
      can do almost everything himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, everything second-rate, cheap, scamped work. That pleases, and he
      pleases, and he is glad it is so&mdash;and so much the better. I&rsquo;m not
      angry; the cantata and I&mdash;we are a pair of old fools; I&rsquo;m a little
      ashamed, but it&rsquo;s no matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Christopher Fedoritch,&rdquo; Lisa said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter,&rdquo; he repeated in Russian, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good girl... but here
      is some one coming to see you. Goodbye. You are a very good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lemm moved with hastened steps towards the gate, through which had
      entered some gentleman unknown to him in a grey coat and a wide straw hat.
      Bowing politely to him (he always saluted all new faces in the town of O&mdash;&mdash;-;
      from acquaintances he always turned aside in the street&mdash;that was the
      rule he had laid down for himself), Lemm passed by and disappeared behind
      the fence. The stranger looked after him in amazement, and after gazing
      attentively at Lisa, went straight up to her.

    <h2>
      Chapter VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recognise me,&rdquo; he said, taking off his hat, &ldquo;but I recognise
      you in spite of its being seven years since I saw you last. You were a
      child then. I am Lavretsky. Is your mother at home? Can I see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma will be glad to see you,&rdquo; replied Lisa; &ldquo;she had heard of your
      arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see, I think your name is Elisaveta?&rdquo; said Lavretsky, as he went
      up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you very well; you had even then a face one doesn&rsquo;t forget. I
      used to bring you sweets in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa blushed and thought what a queer man. Lavretsky stopped for an
      instant in the hall. Lisa went into the drawing-room, where Panshin&rsquo;s
      voice and laugh could be heard; he had been communicating some gossip of
      the town to Marya Dmitrievna, and Gedeonovksy, who by this time had come
      in from the garden, and he was himself laughing aloud at the story he was
      telling. At the name of Lavretsky, Marya Dmitrievna was all in a flutter.
      She turned pale and went up to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, how do you do, my dear cousin?&rdquo; she cried in a plaintive
      and almost tearful voice, &ldquo;how glad I am to see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, cousin?&rdquo; replied Lavretsky, with a friendly pressure of her
      out-stretched hand; &ldquo;how has Providence been treating you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sit down, my dear Fedor Ivanitch. Ah, how glad I am! But let me
      present my daughter Lisa to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already introduced myself to Lisaveta Mihalovna,&rdquo; interposed
      Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsier Panshin... Sergei Petrovitch Gedeonovsky... Please sit down. When
      I look at you, I can hardly believe my eyes. How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you see, I&rsquo;m flourishing. And you, too, cousin&mdash;no ill-luck to
      you!&mdash;have grown no thinner in eight years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think how long it is since we met!&rdquo; observed Marya Dmitrievna
      dreamily. &ldquo;Where have you come from now? Where did you leave... that is, I
      meant to say,&rdquo; she put in hastily, &ldquo;I meant to say, are you going to be
      with us for long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come now from Berlin,&rdquo; replied Lavretsky, &ldquo;and to-morrow I shall
      go into the country&mdash;probably for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will live at Lavriky, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at Lavriky; I have a little place twenty miles from here: I am
      going there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the little estate that came to you from Glafira Petrovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Fedor Ivanitch! You have such a magnificent house at Lavriky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky knitted his brows a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... but there&rsquo;s a small lodge in this little property, and I need
      nothing more for a time. That place is the most convenient for me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna was again thrown into such a state of agitation that she
      became quite stiff, and her hands hung lifeless by her sides. Panshin came
      to her support by entering into conversation with Lavretsky. Marya
      Dmitrievna regained her composure, she leaned back in her arm-chair and
      now and then put in a word. But she looked all the while with such
      sympathy at her guest, sighed so significantly, and shook her head so
      dejectedly, that the latter at last lost patience and asked her rather
      sharply if she was unwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, no,&rdquo; replied Marya Dmitrievna; &ldquo;why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I fancied you didn&rsquo;t seem to be quite yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna assumed a dignified and somewhat offended air. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s
      how the land lies,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s absolutely no matter to me; I see,
      my good fellow, it&rsquo;s all like water on a duck&rsquo;s back for you; any other
      man would have wasted away with grief, but you&rsquo;ve grown fat on it.&rdquo; Marya
      Dmitrievna did not mince matters in her own mind; she expressed herself
      with more elegance aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky certainly did not look like the victim of fate. His rosy-cheeked
      typical Russian face, with its large white brow, rather thick nose, and
      wide straight lips seemed breathing with the wild health of the steppes,
      with vigorous primaeval energy. He was splendidly well-built, and his fair
      curly hair stood up on his head like a boy&rsquo;s. It was only in his blue
      eyes, with their overhanging brows and somewhat fixed look, that one could
      trace an expression, not exactly of melancholy, nor exactly of weariness,
      and his voice had almost too measured a cadence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panshin meanwhile continued to keep up the conversation. He turned it upon
      the profits of sugar-boiling, on which he had lately read two French
      pamphlets, and with modest composure undertook to expound their contents,
      without mentioning, however, a single word about the source of his
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, it is Fedya!&rdquo; came through the half-opened door the voice of
      Marfa Timofyevna in the next room. &ldquo;Fedya himself!&rdquo; and the old woman ran
      hurriedly into the room. Lavretsky had not time to get up from his seat
      before she had him in her arms. &ldquo;Let me have a look at you,&rdquo; she said,
      holding his face off at arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;Ah! what a splendid fellow you are!
      You&rsquo;ve grown older a little, but not a bit changed for the worse, upon my
      word! But why are you kissing my hands&mdash;kiss my face if you&rsquo;re not
      afraid of my wrinkled cheeks. You never asked after me&mdash;whether your
      aunt was alive&mdash;I warrant: and you were in my arms as soon as you
      were born, you great rascal! Well, that is nothing to you, I suppose; why
      should you remember me? But it was a good idea of yours to come back. And
      pray,&rdquo; she added, turning to Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;have you offered him
      something to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything,&rdquo; Lavretsky hastened to declare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you must at least have some tea, my dear. Lord have mercy on us! He
      has come from I don&rsquo;t know where, and they don&rsquo;t even give him a cup of
      tea! Lisa, run and stir them up, and make haste. I remember he was
      dreadfully greedy when he was a little fellow, and he likes good things
      now, I daresay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My respects, Marfa Timofyevna,&rdquo; said Panshin, approaching the delighted
      old lady from one side with a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; replied Marfa Timofyevna, &ldquo;for not observing you in my
      delight. You have grown like your mother, the poor darling,&rdquo; she went on
      turning again to Lavretsky, &ldquo;but your nose was always your father&rsquo;s, and
      your father&rsquo;s it has remained. Well, and are you going to be with us for
      long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to-morrow, aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home to Vassilyevskoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if to-morrow it must be. God bless you&mdash;you know best. Only
      mind you come and say good-bye to me.&rdquo; The old woman patted his cheek. &ldquo;I
      did not think I should be here to see you; not that I have made up my mind
      to die yet a while&mdash;I shall last another ten years, I daresay: all we
      Pestovs live long; your late grandfather used to say we had two lives; but
      you see there was no telling how much longer you were going to dangle
      about abroad. Well, you&rsquo;re a fine lad, a fine lad; can you lift twenty
      stone with one hand as you used to do, eh? Your late pap was fantastical
      in some things, if I may say so; but he did well in having that Swiss to
      bring you up; do you remember you used to fight with your fists with him?&mdash;gymnastics,
      wasn&rsquo;t it they called it? But there, why I am gabbling away like this; I
      have only been hindering Mr. PanSHIN (she never pronounced his name
      PANshin as was correct) from holding forth. Besides, we&rsquo;d better go and
      have tea; yes, let&rsquo;s go on to the terrace, my boy, and drink it there; we
      have some real cream, not like what you get in your Londons and Parises.
      Come along, come along, and you, Fedusha, give me your arm. Oh! but what
      an arm it is! Upon my word, no fear of my stumbling with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one got up and went out on to the terrace, except Gedeonovsky, who
      quietly took his departure. During the whole of Lavretsky&rsquo;s conversation
      with Marya Dmitrievna, Panshin, and Marfa Timofyevna, he sat in a corner,
      blinking attentively, with an open mouth of childish curiosity; now he was
      in haste to spread the news of the new arrival through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock on the evening of the same day, this is what was
      happening in Madame Kalitin&rsquo;s house. Downstairs, Vladimir Nikolaitch,
      seizing a favourable moment, was taking leave of Lisa at the drawing-room
      door, and saying to her, as he held her hand, &ldquo;You know who it is draws me
      here; you know why I am constantly coming to your house; what need of
      words when all is clear as it is?&rdquo; Lisa did not speak, and looked on the
      ground, without smiling, with her brows slightly contracted, and a flush
      on her cheek, but she did not draw away her hands. While up-stairs, in
      Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s room, by the light of a little lamp hanging before the
      tarnished old holy images, Lavretsky was sitting in a low chair, his
      elbows on his knees and his face buried in his hands; the old woamn,
      standing before him, now and then silently stroked his hair. He spent more
      than an hour with her, after taking leave of his hostess; he had scarcely
      said anything to his kind old friend, and she did not question him....
      Indeed, what need to speak, what was there to ask? Without that she
      understood all, and felt for everything of which his heart was full.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fedor Ivanitch Lavretsky&mdash;we must ask the reader&rsquo;s permission to
      break off the thread of our story for a time&mdash;came of an old noble
      family. The founder of the house of Lavretskky came over from Prussia in
      the reign of Vassili the Blind, and received a grant of two hundred
      chetverts of land in Byezhetsk. Many of his descendants filled various
      offices, and served under princes and persons of eminence in outlying
      districts, but not one of them rose above the rank of an inspector of the
      Imperial table nor acquired any considerable fortune. The richest and most
      distinguished of all the Lavretskys was Fedor Ivanitch&rsquo;s
      great-grandfather, Andrei, a man cruel and daring, cunning and able. Even
      to this day stories still linger of his tyranny, his savage temper, his
      reckless munificence, and his insatiable avarice. He was very stout and
      tall, swarthy of countenance and beardless, he spoke in a thick voice and
      seemed half asleep; but the more quietly he spoke the more those about him
      trembled. He had managed to get a wife who was a fit match for him. She
      was a gipsy by birth, goggle-eyed and hook-nosed, with a round yellow
      face. She was irascible and vindictive, and never gave way in anything to
      her husband, who almost killed her, and whose death she did not survive,
      though she had been for ever quarrelling with him. The son of Andrei,
      Piotr, Fedor&rsquo;s grandfather, did not take after his father; he was a
      typical landowner of the steppes, rather a simpleton, loud-voiced, but
      slow to move, coarse but not ill-natured, hospitable and very fond of
      coursing with dogs. He was over thirty when he inherited from his father a
      property of two thousand serfs in capital condition; but he had soon
      dissipated it, and had partly mortgaged his estate, and demoralised his
      servants. All sorts of people of low position, known and unknown, came
      crawling like cockroaches from all parts into his spacious, warm, ill-kept
      halls. All this mass of people ate what they could get, but always had
      their fill, drank till they were drunk, and carried off what they could,
      praising and blessing their genial host; and their host too when he was
      out humour blessed his guests&mdash;for a pack of sponging toadies, but he
      was bored when he was without them. Piotr Andreitch&rsquo;s wife was a
      meek-spirited creature; he had taken her from a neighbouring family by his
      father&rsquo;s choice and command; her name was Anna Pavlovna. She never
      interfered in anything, welcomed guests cordially, and readily paid visits
      herself, though being powdered, she used to declare, would be the death of
      her. &ldquo;They put,&rdquo; she used to say in her old age, &ldquo;a fox&rsquo;s brush on your
      head, comb all the hair up over it, smear it with grease, and dust it over
      with flour, and stick it up with iron pins,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no washing it
      off afterwards; but to pay visits without powder was quite impossible&mdash;people
      would be offended. Ah, it was a torture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She liked being driven with fast-trotting horses, and was ready to play
      cards from morning till evening, and would always keep the score of the
      pennies she had lost or won hidden under her hand when her husband came
      near the card-table; but all her dowry, her whole fortune, she had put
      absolutely at his disposal. She bore him two children, a son Ivan, the
      father of Fedor, and a daughter Glafira. Ivan was not brought up at home,
      but lived with a rich old maiden aunt, the Princess Kubensky; she had
      fixed on him for her heir (but for that his father would not have let him
      go). She dressed him up like a doll, engaged all kinds of teachers for
      him, and put him in charge of a tutor, a Frenchman, who had been an abbe,
      a pupil of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a certain M. Courtin de Vaucelles, a
      subtle and wily intriguer&mdash;the very, as she expressed it, fine fleur
      of emigration&mdash;and finished at almost seventy years old by marrying
      this &ldquo;fine fleur,&rdquo; and making over all her property to him. Soon
      afterwards, covered with rouge, and redolent of perfume a la Richelieu,
      surrounded by negro boys, delicate-shaped greyhounds and shrieking
      parrots, she died on a crooked silken divan of the time of Louis XV., with
      an enamelled snuff-box of Petitot&rsquo;s workmanship in her hand&mdash;and
      died, deserted by her husband; the insinuating M. Courtin had preferred to
      remove to Paris with her money. Ivan had only reached his twentieth year
      when this unexpected blow (we mean the princess&rsquo;s marriage, not her death)
      fell upon him; he did not care to stay in his aunt&rsquo;s house, where he found
      himself suddenly transformed from a wealthy heir to a poor relation; the
      society in Petersburg in which he had grown up was closed to him; he felt
      an aversion for entering the government service in the lower grades, with
      nothing but hard work and obscurity before him,&mdash;this was at the very
      beginning of the reign of the Emperor Alexander. He was obliged
      reluctantly to return to the country to his father. How squalid, poor, and
      wretched his parents&rsquo; home seemed to him! The stagnation and sordidness of
      life in the country offended him at every step. He was consumed with
      ennui. Moreover, every one in the house, except his mother, looked at him
      with unfriendly eyes. His father did not like his town manners, his
      swallow-tail coats, his frilled shirt-fronts, his books, his flute, his
      fastidious ways, in which he detected&mdash;not incorrectly&mdash;a
      disgust for his surroundings; he was for ever complaining and grumbling at
      his son. &ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;is to his taste; at table he is
      all in a fret, and doesn&rsquo;t eat; he can&rsquo;t bear the heat and close smell of
      the room; the sight of folks drunk upsets him, one daren&rsquo;t beat any one
      before him; he doesn&rsquo;t want to go into the government service; he&rsquo;s
      weakly, as you see, in health; fie upon him, the milksop! And all this
      because he&rsquo;s got his head full of Voltaire.&rdquo; The old man had a special
      dislike to Voltaire, and the &ldquo;fanatic&rdquo; Diderot, though he had not read a
      word of their words; reading was not in his line. Piotr Andreitch was not
      mistaken; his son&rsquo;s head for that matter was indeed full of both Diderot
      and Voltaire, and not only of them alone, of Rousseau too, and Helvetius,
      and many other writers of the same kind&mdash;but they were in his head
      only. The retired abbe and encyclopedist who had been Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s
      tutor had taken pleasure in pouring all the wisdom of the eighteenth
      century into his pupil, and he was simply brimming over with it; it was
      there in him, but without mixing in his blood, nor penetrating to his
      soul, nor shaping itself in any firm convictions.... But, indeed, could
      one expect convictions from a young man of fifty years ago, when even at
      the present day we have not succeeded in attaining them? The guests, too,
      who frequented his father&rsquo;s house, were oppressed by Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s
      presence; he regarded them with loathing, they were afraid of him; and
      with his sister Glafira, who was twelve years older than he, he could not
      get on at all. This Glafira was a strange creature; she was ugly, crooked,
      and spare, with severe, wide-open eyes, and thin compressed lips. In her
      face, her voice, and her quick angular movements, she took after her
      grandmother, the gipsy, Andrei&rsquo;s wife. Obstinate and fond of power, she
      would not even hear of marriage. The return of Ivan Petrovitch did not fit
      in with her plans; while the Princess Kubensky kept him with her, she had
      hoped to receive at least half of her father&rsquo;s estate; in her avarice,
      too, she was like her grandmother. Besides, Glafira envied her brother, he
      was so well educated, spoke such good French with a Parisian accent, while
      she was scarcely able to pronounce &ldquo;bon jour&rdquo; or &ldquo;comment vous
      portez-vous.&rdquo; To be sure, her parents did not know any French, but that
      was no comfort to her. Ivan Petrovitch did not know what to do with
      himself for wretchedness and ennui; he had spent hardly a year in the
      country, but that year seemed to him as long as ten. The only consolation
      he could find was in talking to his mother, and he would sit for whole
      hours in her low-pitched rooms, listening to the good woman&rsquo;s
      simple-hearted prattle, and eating preserves. It so happened that among
      Anna Pavlovna&rsquo;s maids there was one very pretty girl with clear soft eyes
      and refined features, Malanya by name, an modest intelligent creature. She
      took his fancy at first sight, and he fell in love with her: he fell in
      love with her timid movements, her bashful answers, her gentle voice and
      gentle smile; every day she seemed sweeter to him. And she became devoted
      to Ivan Petrovitch with all the strength of her soul, as none but Russian
      girls can be devoted&mdash;and she gave herself to him. In the large
      household of a country squire nothing can long be kept a secret; soon
      every one knew of the love between the young master and Malanya; the
      gossip even reached the ears of Piotr Andreitch himself. Under other
      circumstances, he would probably have paid no attention to a matter of so
      little importance, but he had long had a grudge against his son, and was
      delighted at an opportunity of humiliating the town-bred wit and dandy. A
      storm of fuss and clamour was raised; Malanya was locked up in the pantry,
      Ivan Petrovitch was summoned into his father&rsquo;s presence. Anna Pavlovna too
      ran up at the hubbub. She began trying to pacify her husband, but Piotr
      Andreitch would hear nothing. He pounced down like a hawk on his son,
      reproached him with immorality, with godlessness, with hypocrisy; he took
      the opportunity to vent on him all the wrath against the Princess Kubensky
      that had been simmering within him, and lavished abusive epithets upon
      him. At first Ivan Petrovitch was silent and held himself in, but when his
      father thought to fit to threaten him with a shameful punishment he could
      endure it no longer. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the fanatic Diderot is brought out
      again, then I will take the bull by the horns, I will astonish you all.&rdquo;
       And thereupon with a calm and even voice, though quaking inwardly in every
      limb, Ivan Petrovitch declared to his father, that there was no need to
      reproach him with immorality; that though he did not intend to justify his
      fault he was ready to make amends for it, the more willingly as he felt
      himself to be superior to every kind of prejudice&mdash;and in fact&mdash;was
      ready to marry Malanya. In uttering these words Ivan Petrovitch did
      undoubtedly attain his object; he so astonished Piotr Andreitch that the
      latter stood open-eyed, and was struck dumb for a moment; but instantly he
      came to himself, and just as he was, in a dressing-gown bordered with
      squirrel fur and slippers on his bare feet, he flew at Ivan Petrovitch
      with his fists. The latter, as though by design, had that morning arranged
      his locks a la Titus, and put on a new English coat of a blue colour, high
      boots with little tassels and very tight modish buckskin breeches. Anna
      Pavlovna shrieked with all her might and covered her face with her hands;
      but her son ran over the whole house, dashed out into the courtyard,
      rushed into the kitchen-garden, into the pleasure-grounds, and flew across
      into the road, and kept running without looking round till at last he
      ceased to hear the heavy tramp of his father&rsquo;s steps behind him and his
      shouts, jerked out with effort, &ldquo;Stop you scoundrel!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;stop! or
      I will curse you!&rdquo; Ivan Petrovitch took refuge with a neighbour, a small
      landowner, and Piotr Andreitch returned home worn out and perspiring, and
      without taking breath, announced that he should deprive his son of his
      blessing and inheritance, gave orders that all his foolish books should be
      burnt, and that the girl Malanya should be sent to a distant village
      without loss of time. Some kind-hearted people found out Ivan Petrovitch
      and let him know everything. Humiliated and driven to fury, he vowed he
      would be revenged on his father, and the same night lay in wait for the
      peasant&rsquo;s cart in which Malanya was being driven away, carried her off by
      force, galloped off to the nearest town with her and married her. He was
      supplied with money by the neighbour, a good-natured retired marine
      officer, a confirmed tippler, who took an intense delight in every kind of&mdash;as
      he expressed it&mdash;romantic story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Ivan Petrovitch wrote an ironically cold and polite letter to
      Piotr Andreitch, and set off to the village where lived his second cousin,
      Dmitri Pestov, with his sister, already known to the reader, Marfa
      Timofyevna. He told them all, announced his intention to go to Petersburg
      to try to obtain a post there, and besought them, at least for a time, to
      give his wife a home. At the word &ldquo;wife&rdquo; he shed tears, and in spite of
      his city breeding and philosophy he bowed himself in humble, supplicating
      Russian fashion at his relations&rsquo; feet, and even touched the ground with
      his forehead. The Pestovs, kind-hearted and compassionate people, readily
      agreed to his request. He stayed with them for three weeks, secretly
      expecting a reply from his father; but no reply came&mdash;and there was
      no chance of a reply coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Piotr Andreitch, on hearing of his son&rsquo;s marriage, took to his bed, and
      forbade Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s name to be mentioned before him; but his mother,
      without her husband&rsquo;s knowledge, borrowed from the rector, and sent 500
      roubles and a little image to his wife. She was afraid to write, but sent
      a message to Ivan Petrovitch by a lean peasant, who could walk fifty miles
      a day, that he was not to take it too much to heart; that, please God, all
      would be arranged, and his father&rsquo;s wrath would be turned to kindness;
      that she too would have preferred a different daughter-in-law, but that
      she sent Malanya Sergyevna her motherly blessing. The lean peasant
      received a rouble, asked permission to see the new young mistress, to whom
      he happened to be godfather, kissed her hand and ran off at his best
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ivan Petrovitch set off to Petersburg with a light heart. An unknown
      future awaited him; poverty perhaps menaced him, but he had broken away
      from the country life he detested, and above all, he had not been false to
      his teachers, he had actually put into practice the doctrines of Rousseau,
      Diderot, and la Declaration des droits de l&rsquo;homme. A sense of having done
      his duty, of triumph, and of pride filled his soul; and indeed the
      separation from his wife did not greatly afflict him; he would have been
      more perturbed by the necessity of being constantly with her. That deed
      was done, now he wanted to set about doing something fresh. In Petersburg,
      contrary to his own expectations, he met with success; the Princess
      Kubensky, whom Monsieur Courtin had by that time deserted, but who was
      still living, in order to make up in some way to her nephew for having
      wronged him, gave him introductions to all her friends, and presented him
      with 5000 roubles&mdash;almost all that remained of her money&mdash;and a
      Lepkovsky watch with his monogram encircled by Cupids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months had not passed before he obtained a position in a Russian
      embassy to London, and in the first English vessel that sailed (steamers
      were not even talked of then) he crossed the sea. A few months later he
      received a letter from Pestov. The good-natured landowner congratulated
      Ivan Petrovitch on the birth of a son, who had been born into the world in
      the village of Pokrovskoe on the 20th of August, 1807, and named Fedor, in
      honour of the holy martyr Fedor Stratilat. On account of her extreme
      weakness Malanya Sergyevna added only a few lines; but those few lines
      were a surprise, for Ivan Petrovitch had not known that Marfa Timofyevna
      had taught his wife to read and write. Ivan Petrovitch did not long
      abandon himself to the sweet emotion of parental feeling; he was dancing
      attendance on a notorious Phryne or Lais of the day (classical names were
      still in vogue at that date); the Peace of Tilsit had only just been
      concluded and all the world was hurrying after pleasure, in a giddy whirl
      of dissipation, and his head had been turned by the black eyes of a bold
      beauty. He had very little money, but he was lucky at cards, made many
      acquaintances, took part in all entertainments, in a word, he was in the
      swim.

    <h2>
      Chapter IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a long time the old Lavretsky could not forgive his son for his
      marriage. If six months later Ivan Petrovitch had come to him with a
      penitent face and had thrown himself at his feet, he would, very likely,
      have pardoned him, after giving him a pretty severe scolding, and a tap
      with his stick by way of intimidating him, but Ivan Petrovitch went on
      living abroad and apparently did not care a straw. &ldquo;Be silent! I dare you
      to speak of it,&rdquo; Piotr Andreitch said to his wife every time she ventured
      to try to incline him to mercy. &ldquo;The puppy, he ought to thank God for ever
      that I have not laid my curse upon him; my father would have killed him,
      the worthless scamp, with his own hands, and he would have done right
      too.&rdquo; At such terrible speeches Anna Pavlovna could only cross herself
      secretly. As for Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s wife, Piotr Andreitch at first would
      not even hear her name, and in answer to a letter of Pestov&rsquo;s, in which he
      mentioned his daughter-in-law, he went so far as to send him word that he
      knew nothing of any daughter-in-law, and that it was forbidden by law to
      harbour run-away wenches, a fact which he thought it his duty to remind
      him of. But later on, he was softened by hearing of the birth of a
      grandson, and he gave orders secretly that inquiries should be made about
      the health of the mother, and sent her a little money, also as though it
      did not come from him. Fedya was not a year old before Anna Pavlovna fell
      ill with a fatal complaint. A few days before her end, when she could no
      longer leave her bed, with timid tears in her eyes, fast growing dim, she
      informed her husband in the presence of the priest that she wanted to see
      her daughter-in-law and bid her farewell, and to give her grand-child her
      blessing. The heart-broken old man soothed her, and at once sent off his
      own carriage for his daughter-in-law, for the first time giving her the
      title of Malanya Sergyevna. Malanya came with her son and Marfa
      Timofyevna, who would not on any consideration allow her to go alone, and
      was unwilling to expose her to any indignity. Half dead with fright,
      Malanya Sergyevna went into Piotr Andreitch&rsquo;s room. A nurse followed,
      carrying Fedya. Piotr Andreitch looked at her without speaking; she went
      up to kiss his hand; her trembling lips were only just able to touch it
      with a silent kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my upstart lady,&rdquo; he brought out at last, &ldquo;how do you do? let us go
      to the mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and bent over Fedya: the baby smiled and held out his little
      white hands to him. This changed the old man&rsquo;s mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;poor little one, you were pleading for your father; I will
      not abandon you, little bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Directly Malanya Sergyevna entered Anna Pavlovna&rsquo;s bedroom, she fell on
      her knees near the door. Anna Pavlovna beckoned her to come to her
      bedside, embraced her, and blessed her son; then turning a face contorted
      by cruel suffering to her husband she made an effort to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know, what you want to ask,&rdquo; said Piotr Andreitch; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fret
      yourself, she shall stay with us, and I will forgive Vanka for her sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an effort Anna Pavlovna took her husband&rsquo;s hand and pressed it to her
      lips. The same evening she breathed her last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Piotr Andreitch kept his word. He informed his son that for the sake of
      his mother&rsquo;s dying hours, and for the sake of the little Fedor, he sent
      him his blessing and was keeping Malanya Sergyevna in his house. Two rooms
      on the ground floor were devoted to her; he presented her to his most
      honoured guests, the one-eyed brigadier Skurchin, and his wife, and
      bestowed on her two waiting-maids and a page for errands. Marfa Timofyevna
      took leave of her; she detested Glafira, and in the course of one day had
      fallen out with her three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a painful and embarrassing position at first for poor Malanya, but,
      after a while, she learnt to bear it, and grew used to her father-in-law.
      He, too, grew accustomed to her, and even fond of her, though he scarcely
      ever spoke to her, and a certain involuntary contempt was perceptible even
      in his signs of affection to her. Malanya Sergyevna had most to put up
      with from her sister-in-law. Even during her mother&rsquo;s lifetime, Glafira
      had succeeded by degrees in getting the whole household into her hands;
      every one from her father downwards, submitted to her rule; not a piece of
      sugar was given out without her sanction; she would rather have died than
      shared her authority with another mistress&mdash;and with such a mistress!
      Her brother&rsquo;s marriage had incensed her even more than Piotr Andreitch;
      she set herself to give the upstart a lesson, and Malanya Sergyevna from
      the very first hour was her slave. And, indeed, how was she to contend
      against the masterful, haughty Glafira, submissive, constantly bewildered,
      timid, and weak in health as she was? Not a day passed without Glafira
      reminding her of her former position, and commending her for not
      forgetting herself. Malanya Sergyevna could have reconciled herself
      readily to these reminiscences and commendations, however they might be&mdash;but
      Fedya was taken away from her, that was what crushed her. On the pretext
      that she was not capable of undertaking his education, she was scarcely
      allowed to see him; Glafira set herself to that task; the child was put
      absolutely under her control. Malanya Sergyevna began, in her distress, to
      beseech Ivan Petrovitch, in her letters, to return home soon. Piotr
      Andreitch himself wanted to see his son, but Ivan Petrovitch did nothing
      but write. He thanked his father on his wife&rsquo;s account, and for the money
      sent him, promised to return quickly&mdash;and did not come. The year 1812
      at last summoned him home from abroad. When they met again, after six
      years&rsquo; absence, the father embraced his son, and not by a single word made
      allusion to their former differences; it was not a time for that now, all
      Russia was rising up against the enemy, and both of them felt that they
      had Russian blood in their veins. Piotr Andreitch equipped a whole
      regiment of volunteers at his own expense. But the war came to an end, the
      danger was over; Ivan Petrovitch began to be bored again, and again he
      felt drawn away to the distance, to the world in which he had grown up,
      and where he felt himself at home. Malanya Sergyevna could not keep him;
      she meant too little to him. Even her fondest hopes came to nothing; her
      husband considered that it was much more suitable to intrust Fedya&rsquo;s
      education to Glafira. Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s poor wife could not bear this
      blow, she could not bear a second separation; in a few days, without a
      murmur, she quietly passed away. All her life she had never been able to
      oppose anything, and she did not struggle against her illness. When she
      could no longer speak, when the shadows of death were already on her face,
      her features expressed, as of old, bewildered resignation and constant,
      uncomplaining meekness; with the same dumb submissiveness she looked at
      Glafira, and just as Anna Pavlovna kissed her husband&rsquo;s hand on her
      deathbed, she kissed Glafira&rsquo;s, commending to her, to Glafira, her only
      son. So ended the earthly existence of this good and gentle creature,
      torn, God knows why, like an uprooted tree from its natural soil and at
      once thrown down with its roots in the air; she had faded and passed away
      leaving no trace, and no one mourned for her. Malanya Sergyevna&rsquo;s maids
      pitied her, and so did even Piotr Andreitch. The old man missed her silent
      presence. &ldquo;Forgive me... farewell, my meek one!&rdquo; he whispered, as he took
      leave of her the last time in church. He wept as he threw a handful of
      earth in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not survive her long, not more than five years. In the winter of
      the year 1819, he died peacefully in Moscow, where he had moved with
      Glafira and his grandson, and left instructions that he should be buried
      beside Anna Pavlovna and &ldquo;Malasha.&rdquo; Ivan Petrovitch was then in Paris
      amusing himself; he had retired from service soon after 1815. When he
      heard of his father&rsquo;s death he decided to return to Russia. It was
      necessary to make arrangements for the management of the property. Fedya,
      according to Glafira&rsquo;s letter, had reached his twelfth year, and the time
      had come to set about his education in earnest.

    <h2>
      Chapter X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ivan Petrovitch returned to Russia an Anglomaniac. His short-cropped hair,
      his starched shirt-front, his long-skirted pea-green overcoat with its
      multitude of capes, the sour expression of his face, something abrupt and
      at the same time indifferent in his behaviour, his way of speaking through
      his teeth, his sudden wooden laugh, the absence of smiles, his exclusively
      political or politic-economical conversation, his passion for roast beef
      and port wine&mdash;everything about him breathed, so to speak, of Great
      Britain. But, marvelous to relate, while he had been transformed into an
      Anglomaniac, Ivan Petrovitch had at the same time become a patriot, at
      least he called himself a patriot, though he knew Russia little, had not
      retained a single Russian habit, and expressed himself in Russian rather
      queerly; in ordinary conversation, his language was spiritless and
      inanimate and constantly interspersed with Gallicisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Petrovitch brought with him a few schemes in manuscript, relating to
      the administration and reform of the government; he was much displeased
      with everything he saw; the lack of system especially aroused his spleen.
      On his meeting with his sister, at the first word he announced to her that
      he was determined to introduce radical reforms, that henceforth everything
      to do with him would be on a different system. Glafira Petrovna made no
      reply to Ivan Petrovitch; she only ground her teeth and thought: &ldquo;Where am
      I to take refuge?&rdquo; After she was back in the country, however, with her
      brother and nephew, her fears were soon set at rest. In the house,
      certainly, some changes were made; idlers and dependants met with summary
      dismissal; among them two old women were made to suffer, one blind,
      another broken down by paralysis; and also a decrepit major of the days of
      Catherine, who, on account of his really abnormal appetite, was fed on
      nothing but black bread and lentils. The order went forth not to admit the
      guests of former days; they were replaced by a distant neighbour, a
      certain fair-haired, scrofulous baron, a very well educated and very
      stupid man. New furniture was brought from Moscow; spittoons were
      introduced, and bells and washing-stands; and breakfast began to be served
      in a different way; foreign wines replaced vodka and syrups; the servants
      were put into new livery; a motto was added to the family arms: in recto
      virtus... In reality, Glafira&rsquo;s power suffered no diminution; the giving
      out and buying of stores still depended on her. The Alsatian steward,
      brought from abroad, tried to fight it out with her and lost his place, in
      spite of the master&rsquo;s protection. As for the management of the house, and
      the administration of the estate, Glafira Petrovna had undertaken these
      duties also; in spite of Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s intention,&mdash;more than once
      expressed&mdash;to breathe new life into this chaos, everything remained
      as before; only the rent was in some places raised, the mistress was more
      strict, and the peasants were forbidden to apply direct to Ivan
      Petrovitch. The patriot had already a great contempt for his
      fellow-countrymen. Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s system was applied in its full force
      only to Fedya; his education really underwent a &ldquo;radical reformation;&rdquo; his
      father devoted himself exclusively to it.

    <h2>
      Chapter XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Until Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s return from abroad, Fedya was, as already related,
      in the hands of Glafira Petrovna. He was not eight years old when his
      mother died; he did not see her every day, and loved her passionately; the
      memory of her, of her pale and gentle face, of her dejected looks and
      timid caresses, was imprinted on his heart for ever; but he vaguely
      understood her position in the house; he felt that between him and her
      there existed a barrier which she dared not and could not break down. He
      was shy of his father, and, indeed, Ivan Petrovitch on his side never
      caressed him; his grandfather sometimes patted him on the head and gave
      him his hand to kiss, but he thought him and called him a little fool.
      After the death of Malanya Sergyevna, his aunt finally got him under her
      control. Fedya was afraid of her: he was afraid of her bright sharp eyes
      and her harsh voice; he dared not utter a sound in her presence; often,
      when he only moved a little in his chair, she would! hiss out at once:
      &ldquo;What are you doing? sit still.&rdquo; On Sundays, after mass, he was allowed to
      play, that is to say, he was given a thick book, a mysterious book, the
      work of a certain Maimovitch-Ambodik, entitled &ldquo;Symbols and Emblems.&rdquo; This
      book was a medley of about a thousand mostly very enigmatical pictures,
      and as many enigmatical interpretations of them in five languages. Cupid&mdash;naked
      and very puffy in the body&mdash;played a leading part in these
      illustrations. In one of them, under the heading, &ldquo;Saffron and the
      Rainbow,&rdquo; the interpretation appended was: &ldquo;Of this, the influence is
      vast;&rdquo; opposite another, entitled &ldquo;A heron, flying with a violet in his
      beak,&rdquo; stood the inscription: &ldquo;To thee they are all known.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cupid and the
      bear licking his fur&rdquo; was inscribed, &ldquo;Little by little.&rdquo; Fedya used to
      ponder over these pictures; he knew them all to the minutest details; some
      of them, always the same ones, used to set him dreaming, and afforded him
      food for meditation; he! knew no other amusements. When the time came to
      teach him languages and music, Glafira Petrovna engaged, for next to
      nothing, an old maid, a Swede, with eyes like a hare&rsquo;s, who spoke French
      and German with mistakes in every alternate word, played after a fashion
      on the piano, and above all, salted cucumbers to a perfection. In the
      society of this governess, his aunt, and the old servant maid,
      Vassilyevna, Fedya spent four whole years. Often he would sit in the
      corner with his &ldquo;Emblems&rdquo;; he sat there endlessly; there was a scent of
      geranium in the low pitched room, the solitary candle burnt dim, the
      cricket chirped monotonously, as though it were weary, the little clock
      ticked away hurriedly on the wall, a mouse scratched stealthily and gnawed
      at the wall-paper, and the three old women, like the Fates, swiftly and
      silently plied their knitting needles, the shadows raced after their hands
      and quivered strangely in the half darkness, and strange, half dark ideas
      swarmed in the child&rsquo;s brain. No one would have called Fedya an
      interesting child; he was rather pale, but stout, clumsily built and
      awkward&mdash;a thorough peasant, as Glafira Petrovna said; the pallor
      would soon have vanished from his cheeks, if he had been allowed oftener
      to be in the open air. He learnt fairly quickly, though he was often lazy;
      he never cried, but at times he was overtaken by a fit of savage
      obstinacy; then no one could soften him. Fedya loved no one among those
      around him.... Woe to the heart that has not loved in youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Ivan Petrovitch found him, and without loss of time he set to work to
      apply his system to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want above all to make a man, un homme, of him,&rdquo; he said to Glafira
      Petrovna, &ldquo;and not only a man, but a Spartan.&rdquo; Ivan Petrovitch began
      carrying out his intentions by putting his son in a Scotch kilt; the
      twelve-year-old boy had to go about with bare knees and a plume stuck in
      his Scotch cap. The Swedish lady was replaced by a young Swiss tutor, who
      was versed in gymnastics to perfection. Music, as a pursuit unworthy of a
      man, was discarded. The natural sciences, international law, mathematics,
      carpentry, after Jean-Jacques Rousseau&rsquo;s precept, and heraldry, to
      encourage chivalrous feelings, were what the future &ldquo;man&rdquo; was to be
      occupied with. He was waked at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, splashed at
      once with cold water and set to running round a high pole with a cord; he
      had only one meal a day, consisting of a single dish; rode on horseback;
      shot with a cross-bow; at every convenient opportunity he was exercised in
      acquiring after his parent&rsquo;s example firmness of will, and every evening
      he inscribed in a special book an account of the day and his impressions;
      and Ivan Petrovitch on his side wrote him instructions in French in which
      he called him mon fils, and addressed him as vous. In Russian Fedya called
      his father thou, but did not dare to sit down in his presence. The
      &ldquo;system&rdquo; dazed the boy, confused and cramped his intellect, but his health
      on the other hand was benefited by the new manner of his life; at first he
      fell into a fever but soon recovered and began to grow stout and strong.
      His father was proud of him and called him in his strange jargon &ldquo;a child
      of nature, my creation.&rdquo; When Fedya had reached his sixteenth year, Ivan
      Petrovitch thought it his duty in good time to instil into him a contempt
      for the female sex; and the young Spartan, with timidity in his heart and
      the first down on his lip, full of sap and strength and young blood,
      already tried to seem indifferent, cold, and rude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile time was passing. Ivan Petrovitch spent the great part of the
      year in Lavriky (that was the name of the principal estate inherited from
      his ancestors). But in the winter he used to go to Moscow alone; there he
      stayed at a tavern, diligently visited the club, made speeches and
      developed his plans in drawing-rooms, and in his behaviour was more than
      ever Anglomaniac, grumbling and political. But the year 1825 came and
      brought much sorrow. Intimate friends and acquaintances of Ivan Petrovitch
      underwent painful experiences. Ivan Petrovitch made haste to withdraw into
      the country and shut himself up in his house. Another year passed by, and
      suddenly Ivan Petrovitch grew feeble, and ailing; his health began to
      break up. He, the free-thinker, began to go to church and have prayers put
      up for him; he, the European, began to sit in steam-baths, to dine at two
      o&rsquo;clock, to go to bed at nine, and to doze off to the sound of the chatter
      of the old steward; he, the man of! political ideas, burnt all his
      schemes, all his correspondence, trembled before the governor, and was
      uneasy at the sigh of the police-captain; he, the man of iron will,
      whimpered and complained, when he had a gumboil or when they gave him a
      plate of cold soup. Glafira Petrovna again took control of everything in
      the house; once more the overseers, bailiffs and simple peasants began to
      come to the back stairs to speak to the &ldquo;old witch,&rdquo; as the servants
      called her. The change in Ivan Petrovitch produced a powerful impression
      on his son. He had now reached his nineteenth year, and had begun to
      reflect and to emancipate himself from the hand that pressed like a weight
      upon him. Even before this time he had observed a little discrepancy
      between his father&rsquo;s words and deeds, between his wide liberal theories
      and his harsh petty despotism; but he had not expected such a complete
      breakdown. His confirmed egoism was patent now in everything. Young
      Lavretsky was getting ready! to go to Moscow, to prepare for the
      university, when a new unexpected calamity overtook Ivan Petrovitch; he
      became blind, and hopelessly blind, in one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having no confidence in the skill of Russian doctors, he began to make
      efforts to obtain permission to go abroad. It was refused. Then he took
      his son with him and for three whole years was wandering about Russia,
      from one doctor to another, incessantly moving from one town to another,
      and driving his physicians, his son, and his servants to despair by his
      cowardice and impatience. He returned to Lavriky a perfect wreck, a
      tearful and capricious child. Bitter days followed, every one had much to
      put up with from him. Ivan Petrovitch was only quiet when he was dining;
      he had never been so greedy and eaten so much; all the rest of the time he
      gave himself and others no peace. He prayed, cursed his fate, abused
      himself, abused politics, his system, abused everything he had boasted of
      and prided himself upon, everything he had held up to his son as a model;
      he declared that he believed in nothing and then began to pray again; he
      could not put up with one instant of solitude, and expected his household
      to sit by his chair continually day and night, and entertain him with
      stories, which he constantly interrupted with exclamations, &ldquo;You are for
      ever lying,... a pack of nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glafira Petrovna was specially necessary to him; he absolutely could not
      get on without her&mdash;and to the end she always carried out every whim
      of the sick man, though sometimes she could not bring herself to answer at
      once for fear the sound of her voice should betray her inward anger. Thus
      he lingered on for two years and died on the first day of May, when he had
      been brought out on to the balcony into the sun. &ldquo;Glasha, Glashka! soup,
      soup, old foo&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; his halting tongue muttered and before he had
      articulated the last word, it was silent for ever. Glafira Petrovna, who
      had only just taken the cup of soup from the hands of the steward,
      stopped, looked at her brother&rsquo;s face, slowly made a large sign of the
      cross and turned away in silence; and his son, who happened to be there,
      also said nothing; he leaned on the railing of the balcony and gazed a
      long while into the garden, all fragrant and green, and shining in the
      rays of the golden sunshine of spring. He was twenty-three years old; how
      terribly, how imperceptibly quickly those twenty-three years had passed
      by!... Life was opening before him.

    <h2>
      Chapter XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      After burying his father and intrusting to the unchanged Glafira Petrovna
      the management of his estate and superintendence of his bailiffs, young
      Lavretsky went to Moscow, whither he felt drawn by a vague but strong
      attraction. He recognised the defects of his education, and formed the
      resolution, as far as possible, to regain lost ground. In the last five
      years he had read much and seen something; he had many stray ideas in his
      head; any professor might have envied some of his acquirements, but at the
      same time he did not know much that every schoolboy would have learnt long
      ago. Lavretsky was aware of his limitations; he was secretly conscious of
      being eccentric. The Anglomaniac had done his son an ill turn; his
      whimsical education had produced its fruits. For long years he had
      submitted unquestioningly to his father; when at last he began to see
      through him, the evil was already done, his habits were deeply-rooted. He
      could not get on with people; at twenty-three years old, with an
      unquenchable thirst for love in his shy heart, he had never yet dared to
      look one woman in the face. With his intellect, clear and sound, but
      somewhat heavy, with his tendencies to obstinacy, contemplation, and
      indolence he ought from his earliest years to have been thrown into the
      stream of life, and he had been kept instead in artificial seclusion. And
      now the magic circle was broken, but he continued to remain within it,
      prisoned and pent up within himself. It was ridiculous at his age to put
      on a student&rsquo;s dress, but he was not afraid of ridicule; his Spartan
      education had at least the good effect of developing in him a contempt for
      the opinion of others, and he put on, without embarrassment, the
      academical uniform. He entered the section of physics and mathematics.
      Robust, rosy-cheeked, bearded, and taciturn, he produced a strange
      impression on his companions; they did not suspect that this austere man,
      who came so punctually to the lectures in a wide village sledge with a
      pair of horses, was inwardly almost a child. He appeared to them to be a
      queer kind of pedant; they did not care for him, and made no overtures to
      him, and he avoided them. During the first two years he spent in the
      university, he only made acquaintance with one student, from whom he took
      lessons in Latin. This student Mihalevitch by name, an enthusiast and a
      poet, who loved Lavretsky sincerely, by chance became the means of
      bringing about an important change in his destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day at the theatre&mdash;Motchalov was then at the height of his fame
      and Lavretsky did not miss a single performance&mdash;he saw in a box in
      the front tier a young girl, and though no woman ever came near his grim
      figure without setting his heart beating, it had never beaten so violently
      before. The young girl sat motionless, leaning with her elbows on the
      velvet of the box; the light of youth and life played in every feature of
      her dark, oval, lovely face; subtle intelligence was expressed in the
      splendid eyes which gazed softly and attentively from under her fine
      brows, in the swift smile on her expressive lips, in the very pose of her
      head, her hands, her neck. She was exquisitely dressed. Beside her sat a
      yellow and wrinkled woman of forty-five, with a low neck, in a black
      headdress, with a toothless smile on her intently-preoccupied and empty
      face, and in the inner recesses of the box was visible an elderly man in a
      wide frock-coat and high cravat, with an expression of dull dignity and a
      kind of ingratiating distrustfulness in his little eyes, with dyed
      moustache and whiskers, a large meaningless forehead and wrinkled cheeks,
      by every sign a retired general. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off the
      girl who had made such an impression on him; suddenly the door of the box
      opened and Mihalevitch went in. The appearance of this man, almost his one
      acquaintance in Moscow, in the society of the one girl who was absorbing
      his whole attention, struck him as curious and significant. Continuing to
      gaze into the box, he observed that all the persons in it treated
      Mihalevitch as an old friend. The performance on the stage ceased to
      interest Lavretsky, even Motchalov, though he was that evening in his
      &ldquo;best form,&rdquo; did not produce the usual impression on him. At one very
      pathetic part, Lavretsky involuntarily looked at his beauty: she was
      bending forward, her cheeks glowing under the influence of his persistent
      gaze, her eyes, which were fixed on the stage, slowly turned and rested on
      him. All night he was! haunted by those eyes. The skillfully constructed
      barriers were broken down at last; he was in a shiver and a fever, and the
      next day he went to Mihalevitch. From him he learnt that the name of the
      beauty was Varvara Pavlovna Korobyin; that the old people sitting with her
      in the box were her father and mother; and that he, Mihalevitch, had
      become acquainted with them a year before, while he was staying at Count
      N.&lsquo;s, in the position of a tutor, near Moscow. The enthusiast spoke in
      rapturous praise of Varvara Pavlovna. &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he exclaimed with
      the impetuous ring in his voice peculiar to him, &ldquo;that girl is a marvelous
      creature, a genius, an artist in the true sense of the word, and she is
      very good too.&rdquo; Noticing from Lavretsky&rsquo;s inquiries the impression Varvara
      Pavlovna had made on him, he himself proposed to introduce him to her,
      adding that he was like one of the family with them; that the general was
      not at all proud, and the mother was so stupid she could not say &ldquo;Bo&rdquo; to a
      goose. Lavretsky blushed, muttered something unintelligible, and ran away.
      For five whole days he was struggling with his timidity; on the sixth day
      the young Spartan got into a new uniform and placed himself at
      Mihalevitch&rsquo;s disposal. The latter being his own valet, confined himself
      to combing his hair&mdash;and both betook themselves to the Korobyins.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna&rsquo;s father, Pavel Petrovitch Korobyin, a retired
      general-major, had spent his whole time on duty in Petersburg. He had had
      the reputation in his youth of a good dancer and driller. Through poverty,
      he had served as adjutant to two or three generals of no distinction, and
      had married the daughter of one of them with a dowry of twenty-five
      thousand roubles. He mastered all the science of military discipline and
      manoeuvres to the minutest niceties, he went on in harness, till at last,
      after twenty-five years&rsquo; service, he received the rank of a general and
      the command of a regiment. Then he might have relaxed his efforts and have
      quietly secured his pecuniary position. Indeed this was what he reckoned
      upon doing, but he managed things a little incautiously. He devised a new
      method of speculating with public funds&mdash;the method seemed an
      excellent one in itself&mdash;but he neglected to bribe in the right
      place, and was consequently informed against, and a more than unpleasant,
      a disgraceful scandal followed. The general got out of the affair somehow,
      but his career was ruined; he was advised to retire from active duty. For
      two years he lingered on in Petersburg, hoping to drop into some snug
      berth in the civil service, but no such snug berth came in his way. His
      daughter had left school, his expenses were increasing every day.
      Resigning himself to his fate, he decided to remove to Moscow for the sake
      of the greater cheapness of living, and took a tiny low-pitched house in
      the Old Stables Road, with a coat of arms seven feet long on the roof, and
      there began the life of a retired general at Moscow on an income of 2750
      roubles a year. Moscow is a hospitable city, ready to welcome all stray
      comers, generals by preference. Pavel Petrovitch&rsquo;s heavy figure, which was
      not quite devoid of martial dignity, however, soon began to be seen in the
      best drawing-rooms in Moscow. His bald head with its tufts of dyed hair,
      and the soiled ribbon of the Order of St. Anne which he wore over a cravat
      of the colour of a raven&rsquo;s wing, began to be familiar to all the pale and
      listless young men who hang morosely about the card-tables while dancing
      is going on. Pavel Petrovitch knew how to gain a footing in society; he
      spoke little, but from old habit, condescendingly&mdash;though, of course,
      not when he was talking to persons of a higher rank than his own. He
      played cards carefully; ate moderately at home, but consumed enough for
      six at parties. Of his wife there is scarcely anything to be said. Her
      name was Kalliopa Karlovna. There was always a tear in her left eye, on
      the strength of which Kalliopa Karlovna (she was, one must add, of German
      extraction) considered herself a woman of great sensibility. She was
      always in a state of nervous agitation, seemed as though she were
      ill-nourished, and wore a tight velvet dress, a cap, and tarnished hollow
      bracelets. The only daughter of Pavel Petrovitch and Kalliopa Karlovna,
      Varvara Pavlovna, was only just seventeen when she left the
      boarding-school, in which she had been reckoned, if not the prettiest, at
      least the cleverest pupil and the best musician, and where she had taken a
      decoration. She was not yet nineteen, when Lavretsky saw her for the first
      time.

      Chapter XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young Spartan&rsquo;s legs shook under him when Mihalevitch conducted him
      into the rather shabbily furnished drawing-room of the Korobyins, and
      presented him to them. But his overwhelming feeling of timidity soon
      disappeared. In the general the good-nature innate in all Russians was
      intensified by that special kind of geniality which is peculiar to all
      people who have done something disgraceful; the general&rsquo;s lady was as it
      were overlooked by every one; and as for Varvara Pavlovna, she was so
      self-possessed and easily cordial that every one at once felt at home in
      her presence; besides, about all her fascinating person, her smiling eyes,
      her faultlessly sloping shoulders and rosy-tinged white hands, her light
      and yet languid movements, the very sound of her voice, slow and sweet,
      there was an impalpable, subtle charm, like a faint perfume, voluptuous,
      tender, soft, though still modest, something which is hard to translate
      into words, but which moved and kindled&mdash;and timidity! was not the
      feeing it kindled. Lavretsky turned the conversation on the theater, on
      the performance of the previous day; she at once began herself to discuss
      Motchalov, and did not confine herself to sighs and interjections only,
      but uttered a few true observations full of feminine insight in regard to
      his acting. Mihalevitch spoke about music; she sat down without ceremony
      to the piano, and very correctly played some of Chopin&rsquo;s mazurkas, which
      were then just coming into fashion. Dinner-time came; Lavretsky would have
      gone away, but they made him stay: at dinner the general regaled him with
      excellent Lafitte, which the general&rsquo;s lackey hurried off in a
      street-sledge to Dupre&rsquo;s to fetch. Late in the evening Lavretsky returned
      home; for a long while he sat without undressing, covering his eyes with
      his hands in the stupefaction of enchantment. It seemed to him that now
      for the first time he understood what made life worth living; all his
      previous assumptions, all his plans, all that rubbish and nonsense had
      vanished into nothing! at once; all his soul was absorbed in one feeling,
      in one desire&mdash;in the desire of happiness, of possession, of love,
      the sweet love of a woman. From that day he began to go often to the
      Korobyins. Six months later he spoke to Varvara Pavlovna, and offered her
      his hand. His offer was accepted; the general had long before, almost on
      the eve of Lavretsky&rsquo;s first visit, inquired of Mihalevitch how many serfs
      Lavretsky owned; and indeed Varvara Pavlovna, who through the whole time
      of the young man&rsquo;s courtship, and even at the very moment of his
      declaration, had preserved her customary composure and clearness of mind&mdash;Varvara
      Pavlovna too was very well aware that her suitor was a wealthy man; and
      Kalliopa Karlovna thought &ldquo;meine Tochter macht eine schone Partie,&rdquo; and
      bought herself a new cap.

    <h2>
      Chapter XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      And so his offer was accepted, but on certain conditions. In the first
      place, Lavretsky was at once to leave the university; who would be married
      to a student, and what a strange idea too&mdash;how could a landowner, a
      rich man, at twenty-six, take lessons and be at school? Secondly, Varvara
      Pavlovna took upon herself the labour of ordering and purchasing her
      trousseau and even choosing her present from the bridegroom. She had much
      practical sense, a great deal of taste, and a very great love of comfort,
      together with a great faculty for obtaining it for herself. Lavretsky was
      especially struck by this faculty when, immediately after their wedding,
      he traveled alone with his wife in the comfortable carriage, bought by
      her, to Lavriky. How carefully everything with which he was surrounded had
      been thought of, devised and provided beforehand by Varvara Pavlovna! What
      charming knick-knacks appeared from various snug corners, what fascinating
      toilet-cases and coffee-pots, and how delightfully Varvara Pavlovna
      herself made the coffee in the morning! Lavretsky, however, was not at
      that time disposed to be observant; he was blissful, drunk with happiness;
      he gave himself up to it like a child. Indeed he was as innocent as a
      child, this young Hercules. Not in vain was the whole personality of his
      young wife breathing with fascination; not in vain was her promise to the
      senses of a mysterious luxury of untold bliss; her fulfillment was richer
      than her promise. When she reached Lavriky in the very height of the
      summer, she found the house dark and dirty, the servants absurd and
      old-fashioned, but she did not think it necessary even to hint at this to
      her husband. If she had proposed to establish herself at Lavriky, she
      would have changed everything in it, beginning of course with the house;
      but the idea of staying in that out-of-the-way corner of the steppes never
      entered her head for an instant; she lived as in a tent, good-temperedly
      putting up with all its inconveniences, and indulgently making merry over
      then. Marfa Timofyevna came to pay a visit to her former charge; Varvara
      Pavlovna liked her very much, but she did not like Varvara Pavlovna. The
      new mistress did not get on with Glafira Petrovna either; she would have
      left her in peace, but old Korobyin wanted to have a hand in the
      management of his son-in-law&rsquo;s affairs; to superintend the property of
      such a near relative, he said, was not beneath the dignity of even a
      general. One must add that Pavel Petrovitch would not have been above
      managing the property even of a total stranger. Varvara Pavlovna conducted
      her attack very skillfully, without taking any step in advance, apparently
      completely absorbed in the bliss of the honeymoon, in the peaceful life of
      the country, in music and reading, she gradually worked Glafira up to such
      a point that she rushed one morning, like one possessed, into Lavretsky&rsquo;s
      study, and throwing a bunch of keys on the table, she declared that she
      was not equal to undertaking the management any longer, and did not want
      to stop in the place. Lavretsky, having been suitably prepared beforehand,
      at once agreed to her departure. This Glafira Petrovna had not
      anticipated. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, and her face darkened, &ldquo;I see that I
      am not wanted here! I know who is driving me out of the home of my
      fathers. Only you mark my words, nephew; you will never make a home
      anywhere, you will come to be a wanderer for ever. That is my last word to
      you.&rdquo; The same day she went away to her own little property, and in a week
      General Korobyin was there, and with a pleasant melancholy in his looks
      and movements he took the superintendence of the whole property into his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the month of September, Varvara Pavlovna carried her husband off to
      Petersburg. She passed two winters in Petersburg (for the summer she went
      to stay at Tsarskoe Selo), in a splendid, light, artistically-furnished
      flat; they made many acquaintances among the middle and even higher ranks
      of society; went out and entertained a great deal, and gave the most
      charming dances and musical evenings. Varvara Pavlovna attracted guests as
      a fire attracts moths. Fedor Ivanitch did not altogether like such a
      frivolous life. His wife advised him to take some office under government;
      but from old association with his father, and also through his own ideas,
      he was unwilling to enter government service, still he remained in
      Petersburg for Varvara Pavlovna&rsquo;s pleasure. He soon discovered, however,
      that no one hindered him from being alone; that it was not for nothing
      that he had the quietest and most comfortable study in all Petersburg;
      that his tender wife was even ready to aid him to! be alone; and from that
      time forth all went well. He again applied himself to his own, as he
      considered, unfinished education; he began again to read, and even began
      to learn English. It was a strange sight to see his powerful,
      broad-shouldered figure for ever bent over his writing table, his
      full-bearded ruddy face half buried in the pages of a dictionary or
      note-book. Every morning he set to work, then had a capital dinner
      (Varvara Pavlovna was unrivaled as a housekeeper), and in the evenings he
      entered an enchanted world of light and perfume, peopled by gay young
      faces, and the centre of this world was also the careful housekeeper, his
      wife. She rejoiced his heart by the birth of a son, but the poor child did
      not live long; it died in the spring, and in the summer, by the advice of
      the doctors, Lavretsky took his wife abroad to a watering-place.
      Distraction was essential for her after such a trouble, and her health,
      too, required a warm climate. The summer and autumn they spent in Germany
      and Switzerland, and for the winter, as one would naturally expect, they
      went to Paris. In Paris, Varvara Pavlovna bloomed like a rose, and was
      able to make herself a little nest as quickly and cleverly as in
      Petersburg. She found very pretty apartments in one of the quiet but
      fashionable streets in Paris; she embroidered her husband such a
      dressing-gown as he had never worn before; engaged a coquettish waiting
      maid, an excellent cook, and a smart footman, procured a fascinating
      carriage, and an exquisite piano. Before a week had passed, she crossed
      the street, wore her shawl, opened her parasol, and put on her gloves in a
      manner equal to the most true-born Parisian. And she soon drew round
      herself acquaintances. At first, only Russians visited her, afterwards
      Frenchmen too, very agreeable, polite, and unmarried, with excellent
      manners and well-sounding names; they all talked a great deal and very
      fast, bowed easily, grimaced agreeably; their white teeth flashed under
      their rosy lips&mdash;and how they could smile! All! of them brought their
      friends, and la belle Madame de Lavretsky was soon known from Chausee
      d&rsquo;Antin to Rue de Lille. In those days&mdash;it was in 1836&mdash;there
      had not yet arisen the tribe of journalists and reporters who now swarm on
      all sides like ants in an ant-hill; but even then there was seen in
      Varvara Pavlovna&rsquo;s salon a certain M. Jules, a gentleman of
      unprepossessing exterior, with a scandalous reputation, insolent and mean,
      like all duelists and men who have been beaten. Varvara Pavlovna felt a
      great aversion to this M. Jules, but she received him because he wrote for
      various journals, and was incessantly mentioning her, calling her at one
      time Madame de L&mdash;&mdash;-tski, at another Madame de &mdash;&mdash;-,
      cette grande dame russe si distinguee, qui demeure rue de P&mdash;&mdash;-
      and telling all the world, that is, some hundreds of readers who had
      nothing to do with Madame de L&mdash;&mdash;-tski, how charming and
      delightful this lady was; a true Frenchwoman in intelligence (une vraie
      francaise par l&rsquo;esprit)&mdash;Frenchmen have no higher praise than this&mdash;what
      an extraordinary musician she was, and how marvelously she waltzed
      (Varvara Pavlovna did in fact waltz so that she drew all her hearts to the
      hem of her light flying skirts)&mdash;in a word, he spread her fame
      through the world, and, whatever one may say, that is pleasant.
      Mademoiselle Mars had already left the stage, and Mademoiselle Rachel had
      not yet made her appearance; nevertheless, Varvara Pavlovna was assiduous
      in visiting the theatres. She went into raptures over Italian music,
      yawned decorously at the Comedie Francaise, and wept at the acting of
      Madame Dorval in some ultra romantic melodrama; and a great thing&mdash;Liszt
      played twice in her salon, and was so kind, so simple&mdash;it was
      charming! In such agreeable sensations was spent the winter, at the end of
      which Varvara Pavlovna was even presented at court. Fedor Ivanitch, for
      his part, was not bored, though his life, at times, weighed rather heavily
      on him&mdash;because it was empty. He read the papers, listened to the
      lectures at the Sorbonne and the College de France, followed the debates
      in the Chambers, and set to work on a translation of a well-known
      scientific treatise on irrigation. &ldquo;I am not wasting my time,&rdquo; he thought,
      &ldquo;it is all of use; but next winter I must, without fail, return to Russia
      and set to work.&rdquo; It is difficult to say whether he had any clear idea of
      precisely what this work would consist of; and there is no telling whether
      he would have succeeded in going to Russia in the winter; in the meantime,
      he was going with his wife to Baden.. An unexpected incident broke up all
      his plans.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Happening to go one day in Varvara Pavlovna&rsquo;s absence into her boudoir,
      Lavretsky saw on the floor a carefully folded little paper. He
      mechanically picked it up, unfolded it, and read the following note,
      written in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet angel Betsy (I never can make up my mind to call you Barbe or
      Varvara), I waited in vain for you at the corner of the boulevard; come to
      our little room at half-past one to-morrow. Your stout good-natured
      husband (ton gros bonhomme de mari) is usually buried in his books at that
      time; we will sing once more the song of your poet Pouskine (de botre
      poete Pouskine) that you taught me: &lsquo;Old husband, cruel husband!&rsquo; A
      thousand kisses on your little hands and feet. I await you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ernest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky did not at once understand what he had read; he read it a second
      time, and his head began to swim, the ground began to sway under his feet
      like the deck of a ship in a rolling sea. He began to cry out and gasp and
      weep all at the same instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was utterly overwhelmed. He had so blindly believed in his wife; the
      possibility of deception, of treason, had never presented itself to his
      mind. This Ernest, his wife&rsquo;s lover, was a fair-haired pretty boy of
      three-and-twenty, with a little turned-up nose and refined little
      moustaches, almost the most insignificant of all her acquaintances. A few
      minutes passed, half an hour passed, Lavretsky still stood, crushing the
      fatal note in his hands, and gazing senselessly at the floor; across a
      kind of tempest of darkness pale shapes hovered about him; his heart was
      numb with anguish; he seemed to be falling, falling&mdash;and a bottomless
      abyss was opening at his feet. A familiar light rustle of a silk dress
      roused him from his numbness; Varvara Pavlovna in her hat and shawl was
      returning in haste from her walk. Lavretsky trembled all over and rushed
      away; he felt that at that instant he was capable of tearing her to
      pieces, beating her to death, as a peasant might do, strangling her with
      his own hands. Varvara Pavlovna in amazement tried to stop him; he could
      only whisper, &ldquo;Betsy,&rdquo;&mdash;and ran out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky took a cab and ordered the man to drive him out of town. All the
      rest of the day and the whole night he wandered about, constantly stopping
      short and wringing his hands, at one moment he was mad, and the next he
      was ready to laugh, was even merry after a fashion. By the morning he grew
      calm through exhaustion, and went into a wretched tavern in the outskirts,
      asked for a room and sat down on a chair before the window. He was
      overtaken by a fit of convulsive yawning. He could scarcely stand upright,
      his whole body was worn out, and he did not even feel fatigue, though
      fatigue began to do its work; he sat and gazed and comprehended nothing;
      he did not understand what had happened to him, why he found himself
      alone, with his limbs stiff, with a taste of bitterness in his mouth, with
      a load on his heart, in an empty unfamiliar room; he did not understand
      what had impelled her, his Varya, to give herself to this Frenchman, and
      how, knowing herself unfaithful, she could go on being just as calm, just
      as affectionate, as confidential with him as before! &ldquo;I cannot understand
      it!&rdquo; his parched lips whispered. &ldquo;Who can guarantee now that even in
      Petersburg&rdquo;... And he did not finish the question, and yawned again,
      shivering and shaking all over. Memories&mdash;bright and gloomy&mdash;fretted
      him alike; suddenly it crossed his mind how some days before she had sat
      down to the piano and sung before him and Ernest the song, &ldquo;Old husband,
      cruel husband!&rdquo; He recalled the expression of her face, the strange light
      in her eyes, and the colour on her cheeks&mdash;and he got up from his
      seat, he would have liked to go to them, to tell them: &ldquo;You were wrong to
      play your tricks on me; my great-grandfather used to hang the peasants up
      by their ribs, and my grandfather was himself a peasant,&rdquo; and to kill them
      both. Then all at once it seemed to him as if all that was happening was a
      dream, scarcely even a dream, but some kind of foolish joke; that he need
      only shake himself and look round... He looked round, and like a! hawk
      clutching its captured prey, anguish gnawed deeper and deeper into his
      heart. To complete it all Lavretsky had been hoping in a few months to be
      a father.... The past, the future, his whole life was poisoned. He went
      back at last to Paris, stopped at an hotel and sent M. Ernest&rsquo;s note to
      Varvara Pavlovna with the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The enclosed scrap of paper will explain everything to you. Let me tell
      you by the way, that I was surprised at you; you, who are always so
      careful, to leave such valuable papers lying about.&rdquo; (Poor Lavretsky had
      spent hours preparing and gloating over this phrase.) &ldquo;I cannot see you
      again; I imagine that you, too, would hardly desire an interview with me.
      I am assigning you 15,000 francs a year; I cannot give more. Send your
      address to the office of the estate. Do what you please; live where you
      please. I wish you happiness. No answer is needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky wrote to his wife that he needed no answer... but he waited, he
      thirsted for a reply, for an explanation of this incredible, inconceivable
      thing. Varvara Pavlovna wrote him the same day a long letter in French. It
      put the finishing touch; his last doubts vanished,&mdash;and he began to
      feel ashamed that he had still had any doubt left. Varvara Pavlovna did
      not attempt to defend herself; her only desire was to see him, she
      besought him not to condemn her irrevocably. The letter was cold and
      constrained, though here and there traces of tears were visible. Lavretsky
      smiled bitterly, and sent word by the messenger that it was all right.
      Three days later he was no longer in Paris; but he did not go to Russia,
      but to Italy. He did not know himself why he fixed upon Italy; he did not
      really care where he went&mdash;so long as it was not home. He sent
      instructions to his steward on the subject of his wife&rsquo;s allowance, and at
      the same time told him to take all control of his property out of General
      Korobyin&rsquo;s hands at once, without waiting for him to draw up an account,
      and to make arrangements for his Excellency&rsquo;s departure from Lavriky; he
      could picture vividly the confusion, the vain airs of self-importance of
      the dispossessed general, and in the midst of all his sorrow, he felt a
      kind of spiteful satisfaction. At the same time he asked Glafira Petrovna
      by letter to return to Lavriky, and drew up a deed authorising her to take
      possession; Glafira Petrovna did not return to Lavriky, and printed in the
      newspapers that the deed was cancelled, which was perfectly unnecessary on
      her part. Lavretsky kept out of sight in a small Italian town, but for a
      long time he could not help following his wife&rsquo;s movements. From the
      newspapers he learned that she had gone from Paris to Baden as she had
      arranged; her name soon appeared in an article written by the same M.
      Jules. In this article there was a kind of sympathetic condolence apparent
      under the habitual playfulness; there was a deep sense of disgust in the
      soul of Fedor Ivanitch as he read this article. Afterwards he learned that
      a daughter had been born to him; two months later he received a
      notification from his steward that Varvara Pavlovna had asked for the
      first quarter&rsquo;s allowance. Then worse and worse rumors began to reach him;
      at last, a tragic-comic story was reported with acclamations in all the
      papers. His wife played an unenviable part in it. It was the finishing
      stroke; Varvara Pavlovna had become a &ldquo;notoriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky ceased to follow her movements; but he could not quickly gain
      mastery over himself. Sometimes he was overcome by such a longing for his
      wife that he would have given up everything, he thought, even, perhaps...
      could have forgiven her, only to hear her caressing voice again, to feel
      again her hand in his. Time, however, did not pass in vain. He was not
      born to be a victim; his healthy nature reasserted its rights. Much became
      clear to him; even the blow that had fallen on him no longer seemed to him
      to have been quite unforeseen; he understood his wife,&mdash;we can only
      fully understand those who are near to us, when we are separated from
      them. He could take up his interests, could work again, though with
      nothing like his former zeal; scepticism, half-formed already by the
      experiences of his life, and by his education, took complete possession of
      his heart. He became indifferent to everything. Four years passed by, and
      he felt himself strong enough to return to his country, to meet his own
      people. Without stopping at Petersburg or at Moscow he came to the town of
      O&mdash;&mdash;-, where we parted from him, and whither we will now ask
      the indulgent reader to return with us.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning after the day we have described, at ten o&rsquo;clock, Lavretsky was
      mounting the steps of the Kalitins&rsquo; house. He was met by Lisa coming out
      in her hat and gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To service. It is Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa looked at him in silent amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Lavretsky; &ldquo;I&mdash;I did not mean to say that;
      I have come to say good-bye to you, I am starting for my village in an
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it far from here?&rdquo; asked Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lenotchka made her appearance in the doorway, escorted by a maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t forget us,&rdquo; observed Lisa, and went down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you forget me. And listen,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you are going to church;
      while you are there, pray for me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa stopped short and turned round to him: &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she said, looking
      him straight in the face, &ldquo;I will pray for you too. Come, Lenotchka.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room Lavretsky found Marya Dmitrievna alone. She was
      redolent of eau de Cologne and mint. She had, as she said, a headache, and
      had passed a restless night. She received him with her usual languid
      graciousness and gradually fell into conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vladimir Nikolaitch is really a delightful young man, don&rsquo;t you think
      so?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Vladimir Nikolaitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Panshin to be sure, who was here yesterday. He took a tremendous fancy to
      you; I will tell you a secret, mon cher cousin, he is simply crazy about
      my Lisa. Well, he is of good family, has a capital position in the
      service, and a clever fellow, a kammer-yunker, and if it is God&rsquo;s will, I
      for my part, as a mother, shall be well pleased. My responsibility of
      course is immense; the happiness of children depends, no doubt, on parts;
      still I may say, up till now, for better or for worse I have done
      everything, I alone have been everywhere with them, that is to say, I have
      educated my children and taught them everything myself. Now, indeed, I
      have written for a French governess from Madame Boluce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna launched into a description of her cares and anxieties
      and maternal sentiments. Lavretsky listened in silence, turning his hat in
      his hands. His cold, weary glance embarrassed the gossiping lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you like Lisa?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisaveta Mihalovna is an excellent girl,&rdquo; replied Lavretsky, and he got
      up, took his leave, and went off to Marfa Timofyevna. Marya Dmitrievna
      looked after him in high displeasure, and thought, &ldquo;What a dolt, a regular
      peasant! Well, now I understand why his wife could not remain faithful to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna was sitting in her room, surrounded by her little court.
      It consisted of five creatures almost equally near to her heart; a
      big-cropped, learned bullfinch, which she had taken a fancy to because he
      had lost his accomplishments of whistling and drawing water; a very timid
      and peaceable little dog, Roska; an ill-tempered cat, Matross; a
      dark-faced, agile little girl nine years old, with big eyes and a sharp
      nose, call Shurotchka; and an elderly woman of fifty-five, in a white cap
      and a cinnamon-coloured abbreviated jacket, over a dark skirt, by name,
      Nastasya Karpovna Ogarkov. Shurotchka was an orphan of the tradesman
      class. Marfa Timofyevna had taken her to her heart like Roska, from
      compassion; she had found the little dog and the little girl too in the
      street; both were thin and hungry, both were being drenched by the autumn
      rain; no one came in search of Roska, and Shurotchka was given up to Marfa
      Timofyevna with positive eagerness by her uncle, a drunken shoemaker, who
      did not get enough to eat himself, and did not feed his niece, but beat
      her over the head with his last. With Nastasya Karpovna, Marfa Timofyevna
      had made acquaintance on a pilgrimage at a monastery; she had gone up to
      her at the church (Marfa Timofyevna took a fancy to her because in her own
      words she said her prayers so prettily) and had addressed her and invited
      her to a cup of tea. From that day she never parted from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasya Karpovna was a woman of the most cheerful and gentle disposition,
      a widow without children, of a poor noble family; she had a round grey
      head, soft white hands, a soft face with large mild features, and a rather
      absurd turned-up nose; she stood in awe of Marfa Timofyevna, and the
      latter was very fond of her, though she laughed at her susceptibility. She
      had a soft place in her heart for every young man, and could not help
      blushing like a girl at the most innocent joke. Her whole fortune
      consisted of only 1200 roubles; she lived at Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s expense,
      but on an equal footing with her: Marfa Timofyevna would not have put up
      with any servility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Fedya,&rdquo; she began, directly she saw him, &ldquo;last night you did not see
      my family, you must admire them, we are all here together for tea; this is
      our second, holiday tea. You can make friends with them all; only
      Shurotchka won&rsquo;t let you, and the cat will scratch. Are you starting
      to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Lavretsky sat down on a low seat, &ldquo;I have just said good-bye to
      Marya Dmitrievna. I saw Lisaveta Mihalovna too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call her Lisa, my dear fellow. Mihalovna indeed to you! But sit still, or
      you will break Shurotchka&rsquo;s little chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has gone to church,&rdquo; continued Lavretsky. &ldquo;Is she religious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Fedya, very much so. More than you and I, Fedya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you religious then?&rdquo; lisped Nastasya Karpovna. &ldquo;To-day, you have
      not been to the early service, but you are going to the late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all; you will go alone; I have grown too lazy, my dear,&rdquo;
       relied Marfa Timofyevna. &ldquo;Already I am indulging myself with tea.&rdquo; She
      addressed Nastasya Karpovna in the singular, though she treated her as an
      equal. She was not a Pestov for nothing: three Pestovs had been on the
      death-list of Ivan the Terrible, Marfa Timofyevna was well aware of the
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me please,&rdquo; began Lavretsky again, &ldquo;Marya Dmitrievna has just been
      talking to me about this&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name? Panshin. What sort of a
      man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a chatterbox she is, Lord save us!&rdquo; muttered Marfa Timofyevna. &ldquo;She
      told you, I suppose, as a secret that he has turned up as a suitor. She
      might have whispered it to her priest&rsquo;s son; no, he&rsquo;s not good enough for
      her, it seems. And so far there&rsquo;s nothing to tell, thank God, but already
      she&rsquo;s gossiping about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why thank God?&rdquo; asked Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t like the fine young gentleman; and so what is there to be
      glad of in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he can&rsquo;t fascinate every one. He must be satisfied with Nastasya
      Karpovna&rsquo;s being in love with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor widow was utterly dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you, Marfa Timofyevna? you&rsquo;ve no conscience!&rdquo; she cried, and a
      crimson flush instantly overspread her face and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he knows, to be sure, the rogue,&rdquo; Marfa Timofyevna interrupted her,
      &ldquo;he knows how to captivate her; he made her a present of a snuff-box.
      Fedya, ask her for a pinch of snuff; you will see what a splendid
      snuff-box it is; on the lid a hussar on horseback. You&rsquo;d better not try to
      defend yourself, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasya Karpovna could only fling up her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but Lisa,&rdquo; inquired Lavretsky, &ldquo;is she indifferent to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems to like him, but there, God knows! The heart of another, you
      know, is a dark forest, and a girl&rsquo;s more than any. Shurotchka&rsquo;s heart,
      for instance&mdash;I defy you to understand it! What makes her hide
      herself and not come out ever since you came in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shurotchka choked with suppressed laughter and skipped out of the room.
      Lavretsky rose from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said in an uncertain voice, &ldquo;there is no deciphering a girl&rsquo;s
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to say good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, shall we see you again soon?&rdquo; inquired Marfa Timofyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, aunt: it&rsquo;s not far off, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure you are going to Vassilyevskoe. You don&rsquo;t care to stay at
      Lavriky: well, that&rsquo;s your own affair, only mind you go and say a prayer
      at our mother&rsquo;s grave, and our grandmother&rsquo;s too while you are there. Out
      there in foreign parts you have picked up all kinds of ideas, but who
      knows? Perhaps even in their graves they will feel that you have come to
      them. And, Fedya, don&rsquo;t forget to have a service sung too for Glafira
      Petrovna; here&rsquo;s a silver rouble for you. Take it, take it, I want to pay
      for a service for her. I had no love for her in her lifetime, but all the
      same there&rsquo;s no denying she was a girl of character. She was a clever
      creature; and a good friend to you. And now go and God be with you, before
      I weary you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Marfa Timofyevna embraced her nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lisa&rsquo;s not going to marry Panshin; don&rsquo;t you trouble yourself; that&rsquo;s
      not the sort of husband she deserves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not troubling myself,&rdquo; answered Lavretsky, and went away.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Four days later, he set off for home. His coach rolled quickly along the
      soft cross-road. There had been no rain for a fortnight; a fine milk mist
      was diffused in the air and hung over the distant woods; a smell of
      burning came from it. A multitude of darkish clouds with blurred edges
      were creeping across the pale blue sky; a fairly strong breeze blew a dry
      and steady gale, without dispelling the heat. Leaning back with his head
      on the cushion and his arms crossed on his breast, Lavretsky watched the
      furrowed fields unfolding like a fan before him, the willow bushes as they
      slowly came into sight, and the dull ravens and rooks, who looked sidelong
      with stupid suspicion at the approaching carriage, the long ditches,
      overgrown with mugwort, wormwood, and mountain ash; and as he watched the
      fresh fertile wilderness and solitude of this steppe country, the
      greenness, the long slopes, and valleys with stunted oak bushes, the grey
      villages, and scant birch trees,&mdash;the whole Russian landscape, so
      long unseen by him, stirred emotion at once pleasant, sweet and almost
      painful in his heart, and he felt weighed down by a kind of pleasant
      oppression. Slowly his thoughts wandered; their outlines were as vague and
      indistinct as the outlines of the clouds which seemed to be wandering at
      random overhead. He remembered his childhood, his mother; he remembered
      her death, how they had carried him in to her, and how, clasping his head
      to her bosom, she had begun to wail over him, then had glanced at Glafira
      Petrovna&mdash;and checked herself. He remembered his father, at first
      vigorous, discontented with everything, with strident voice; and later,
      blind, tearful, with unkempt grey beard; he remembered how one day after
      drinking a glass too much at dinner, and spilling the gravy over his
      napkin, he began to relate his conquests, growing red in the face, and
      winking with his sightless eyes; he remember Varvara Pavlovna,&mdash;and
      involuntarily shuddered, as a man shudders from a sudden internal pain,
      and shook his head. Then his! thoughts came to a stop at Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;Is a new creature, only just entering on life. A
      nice girl, what will become of her? She is good-looking too. A pale, fresh
      face, mouth and eyes so serious, and an honest innocent expression. It is
      a pity she seems a little enthusiastic. A good figure, and she moves so
      lightly, and a soft voice. I like the way she stops suddenly, listens
      attentively, without a smile, then grows thoughtful and shakes back her
      hair. I fancy, too, that Panshin is not good enough for her. What&rsquo;s amiss
      with him, though? And besides, what business have I to wonder about it?
      She will go along the same road as all the rest. I had better go to
      sleep.&rdquo; And Lavretsky closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not sleep, but he sank into the drowsy numbness of a journey.
      Images of the past rose slowly as before, floated in his soul, mixed and
      tangled up with other fancies. Lavretsky, for some unknown reason, began
      to think about Robert Peel,... about French history&mdash;of how he would
      gain a battle, if he were a general; he fancied the shots and the cries
      .... His head slipped on one side, he opened his eyes. The same fields,
      the same steppe scenery; the polished shoes of the trace-horses flashed
      alternately through the driving dust; the coachman&rsquo;s shirt, yellow with
      red gussets, was puffed out by the wind.... &ldquo;A nice home-coming!&rdquo; glanced
      through Lavretsky&rsquo;s brain; and he cried, &ldquo;Get on!&rdquo; wrapped himself in his
      cloak and pressed close into the cushion. The carriage jolted; Lavretsky
      sat up and opened his eyes wide. On the slope before him stretched a small
      hamlet; a little to the right could be seen an ancient manor house of
      small size, with closed shutters! and a winding flight of steps; nettles,
      green and thick as hemp, grew over the wide courtyard from the very gates;
      in it stood a storehouse built of oak, still strong. This was
      Vassilyevskoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman drove to the gates and drew up; Lavretsky&rsquo;s groom stood up on
      the box and as though in preparation for jumping down, shouted, &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
       There was a sleepy, muffled sound of barking, but not even a dog made its
      appearance; the groom again made ready for a jump, and again shouted
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; The feeble barking was repeated, and an instant after a man from
      some unseen quarter ran into the courtyard, dressed in a nankeen coat, his
      head as white as snow; he stared at the coach, shading his eyes from the
      sun; all at once he slapped his thighs with both hands, ran to and fro a
      little, then rushed to open the gates. The coach drove into the yard,
      crushing the nettles with the wheels, and drew up at the steps. The
      white-headed man, who seemed very alert, was already standing on the
      bottom step, his legs bent and wide apart, he unfastened the apron of the
      carriage, holding back the strap with a jerk and aiding his master to
      alight; he kissed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, how do you do, brother?&rdquo; began Lavretsky. &ldquo;Your name&rsquo;s
      Anton, I think? You are still alive, then?&rdquo; The old man bowed without
      speaking, and ran off for the keys. While he went, the coachman sat
      motionless, sitting sideways and staring at the closed door, but
      Lavretsky&rsquo;s groom stood as he had leaped down in a picturesque pose with
      one arm thrown back on the box. The old man brought the keys, and, quite
      needlessly, twisting about like a snake, with his elbows raised high, he
      opened the door, stood on one side, and again bowed to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here I am at home, here I am back again,&rdquo; thought Lavretsky, as he
      walked into the diminutive passage, while one after another the shutters
      were being opened with much creaking and knocking, and the light of day
      poured into the deserted rooms.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The small manor-house to which Lavretsky had come and in which two years
      before Glafira Petrovna had breathed her last, had been built in the
      preceding century of solid pine-wood; it looked ancient, but it was still
      strong enough to stand another fifty years or more. Lavretsky made the
      tour of all the rooms, and to the great discomfiture of the aged languid
      flies, settled under the lintels and covered with white dust, he ordered
      the windows to be opened everywhere; they had not been opened ever since
      the death of Glafira Petrovna. Everything in the house had remained as it
      was; the thin-legged white miniature couches in the drawing-room, covered
      with glossy grey stuff, threadbare and rickety, vividly suggested the days
      of Catherine; in the drawing-room, too, stood the mistress&rsquo;s favourite
      arm-chair, with high straight back, against which she never leaned even in
      her old age. On the principal wall hung a very old portrait of Fedor&rsquo;s
      great-grandfather, Andrey Lavretsky; the dark yellow face was scarcely
      distinguishable from the warped and blackened background; the small cruel
      eyes looked grimly out from beneath the eyelids, which dropped as if they
      were swollen; his black unpowdered hair rose bristling above his heavy
      indented brow. In the corner of the portrait hung a wreath of dusty
      immortelles. &ldquo;Glafira Petrovna herself was pleased to make it,&rdquo; Anton
      announced. In the bedroom stood a narrow bedstead, under a canopy of
      old-fashioned and very good striped material; a heap of faded cushions and
      a thin quilted counterpane lay on the bed, and at the head hung a picture
      of the Presentation in the Temple of the Holy Mother of God; it was the
      very picture which the old maid, dying alone and forgotten by every one,
      had for the last time pressed to her chilling lips. A little toilet table
      of inlaid wood, with brass fittings and a warped looking-glass in a
      tarnished frame stood in the window. Next to the bedroom was the little
      ikon room with bare walls and a heavy case of holy images in the corner;
      on the floor lay a threadbare rug spotted with wax; Glafira Petrovna used
      to pray bowing to the ground upon it. Anton went away with Lavretsky&rsquo;s
      groom to unlock the stable and coach-house; to replace him appeared an old
      woman of about the same age, with a handkerchief tied round to her very
      eyebrows; her head shook, and her eyes were dim, but they expressed zeal,
      the habit of years of submissive service, and at the same time a kind of
      respectful commiseration. She kissed Lavretsky&rsquo;s hand and stood still in
      the doorway awaiting his orders. He positively could not recollect her
      name and did not even remember whether he had ever seen her. Her name, it
      appeared, was Apraxya; forty years before, Glafira Petrovna had put her
      out of the master&rsquo;s house and ordered that she should be a poultry woman.
      She said little, however; she seemed to have lost her senses from old age,
      and could only gaze at him obsequiously. Besides these two old creatures
      and three pot-bellied children in long smocks, Anton&rsquo;s
      great-grandchildren, there was also living in the manor-house a one-armed
      peasant, who was exempted from servitude; he muttered like a woodcock and
      was of no use for anything. Not much more useful was the decrepit dog who
      had saluted Lavretsky&rsquo;s return by its barking; he had been for ten years
      fastened up by a heavy chain, purchased at Glafira Petrovna&rsquo;s command, and
      was scarcely able to move and drag the weight of it. Having looked over
      the house, Lavretsky went into the garden and was very much pleased with
      it. It was all overgrown with high grass, and burdock, and gooseberry and
      raspberry bushes, but there was plenty of shade, and many old lime-trees,
      which were remarkable for their immense size and the peculiar growth of
      their branches; they had been planted too close and at some time or other&mdash;a
      hundred years before&mdash;they had been lopped. At the end of the garden
      was a small clear pool bordered with high reddish rushes. The traces of
      human life very quickly! pass away; Glafira Petrovna&rsquo;s estate had not had
      time to become quite wild, but already it seemed plunged in that quiet
      slumber in which everything reposes on earth where there is not the
      infection of man&rsquo;s restlessness. Fedor Ivanitch walked also through the
      village; the peasant-women stared at him from the doorways of their huts,
      their cheeks resting on their hands; the peasants saluted him from a
      distance, the children ran out, and the dogs barked indifferently. At last
      he began to feel hungry; but he did not expect his servants and his cook
      till the evening; the waggons of provisions from Lavriky had not come yet,
      and he had to have recourse to Anton. Anton arranged matters at once; he
      caught, killed, and plucked an old hen; Apraxya gave it a long rubbing and
      cleaning, and washed it like linen before putting it into the stew-pan;
      when, at last, it was cooked Anton laid the cloth and set the table,
      placing beside the knife and fork a three-legged salt-cellar of tarnished
      plate and a cut decanter with a round glass stopper and a narrow neck;
      then he announced to Lavretsky in a sing-song voice that the meal was
      ready, and took his stand behind his chair, with a napkin twisted round
      his right fights, and diffusing about him a peculiar strong ancient odour,
      like the scent of a cypress-tree. Lavretsky tried the soup, and took out
      the hen; its skin was all covered with large blisters; a tough tendon ran
      up each leg; the meat had a flavour of wood and soda. When he had finished
      dinner, Lavretsky said that he would drink a cup of tea, if&mdash;&ldquo;I will
      bring it this minute,&rdquo; the old man interrupted. And he kept his word. A
      pinch of tea was hunted up, twisted in a screw of red paper; a small but
      very fiery and loudly-hissing samovar was found, and sugar too in small
      lumps, which looked as if they were thawing. Lavretsky drank tea out of a
      large cup; he remembered this cup from childhood; there were playing-cards
      depicted upon it, only visitors used to drink out of it&mdash;and here was
      he drinking out if like a visitor. In the evening his servants came;
      Lavretsky did not care to sleep in his aunt&rsquo;s bed; he directed them put
      him up a bed in the dining-room. After extinguishing his candle he stared
      for a long time about him and feel into cheerless reflection; he
      experienced that feeling which every man knows whose lot it is to pass the
      night in a place long uninhabited; it seemed to him that the darkness
      surrounding him on all sides could not be accustomed to the new
      inhabitant, the very walls of the house seemed amazed. At last he sighed,
      drew up the counterpane round him and fell asleep. Anton remained up after
      all the rest of the household; he was whispering a long while with
      Apraxya, he sighed in an undertone, and twice he crossed himself; they had
      neither of them expected that their master would settle among them at
      Vassilyevskoe when he had not far off such a splendid estate with such a
      capitally built house; they did not suspect that the very house was
      hateful to Lavretsky; it stirred painful memories within him. Having
      gossiped to his heart&rsquo;s content, Anton took a stick and struck the night
      watchman&rsquo;s board, which had hung silent for so many years, and laid down
      to sleep in the courtyard with no covering on his white head. The May
      night was mild and soft, and the old man slept sweetly.

    <h2>
      Chapter XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Lavretsky got up rather early, had a talk with the village
      bailiff, visited the threshing-floor, ordered the chain to be taken off
      the yard dog, who only barked a little but did not even come out of his
      kennel, and returning home, sank into a kind of peaceful torpor, which he
      did not shake off the whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am at the very bottom of the river,&rdquo; he said to himself more than
      once. He sat at the window without stirring, and, as it were, listened to
      the current of the quiet life surrounding him, to the few sounds of the
      country solitude. Something from behind the nettles chirps with a shrill,
      shrill little note; a gnat seems to answer it. Now it has ceased, but
      still the gnat keeps up its sharp whirr; across the pleasant, persistent,
      fretful buzz of the flies sounds the hum of a big bee, constantly knocking
      its head against the ceiling; a cock crows in the street, hoarsely
      prolonging the last note; there is the rattle of a cart; in the village a
      gate is creaking. Then the jarring voice of a peasant woman, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey,
      you are my little sweetheart,&rdquo; cries Anton to the little two-year-old girl
      he is dandling in his arms. &ldquo;Fetch the kvas,&rdquo; repeats the same woman&rsquo;s
      voice, and all at once there follows a deathly silence; nothing rattles,
      nothing is moving; the wind is not stirring a leaf; without a sound the
      swallows fly one after another over the earth, and sadness weights on the
      heart from their noiseless flight. &ldquo;Here I am at the very bottom of the
      river,&rdquo; thought Lavretsky again. &ldquo;And always, at all times life here is
      quiet, unhasting,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;whoever comes within its circle must
      submit; here there is nothing to agitate, nothing to harass; one can only
      get on here by making one&rsquo;s way slowly, as the ploughman cuts the furrow
      with his plough. And what vigour, what health abound in this inactive
      place! Here under the window the sturdy burdock creeps out of the thick
      grass; above it the lovage trails its juicy stalks and the Virgin&rsquo;s tears
      fling still higher their pink tendrils; and yonder further in the fields
      is the silky rye, and the oats are already in ear, and every leaf on every
      tree, every grass on its stalk is spread to its fullest width. In the love
      of a woman my best years have gone by,&rdquo; Lavretsky went on thinking, &ldquo;let
      me be sobered by the sameness of life here, let me be soothed and made
      ready, so that I may learn to do my duty without haste.&rdquo; And again he fell
      to listening to the silence, expecting nothing&mdash;and at the same time
      constantly expecting something; the silence enfolded him on all sides, the
      sun moved calmly in the peaceful blue sky, and the clouds sailed calmly
      across it; they seemed to know why and whither they were sailing. At this
      same time in other places on the earth there is the seething, the bustle,
      the clash of life; life here slipped by noiseless, as water over marshy
      grass; and even till evening Lavretsky could not tear himself from the
      contemplation of this life as it passed and glided by; sorrow for the past
      was melting in his soul like snow in spring, and strange to say, never had
      the feeling of home been so deep and strong within him.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the course of a fortnight, Fedor Ivanitch had brought Glafira
      Petrovna&rsquo;s little house into order and had cleared the court-yard and the
      garden. From Lavriky comfortable furniture was sent him; from the town,
      wine, books, and papers; horses made their appearance in the stable; in
      brief Fedor Ivanitch provided himself with everything necessary and began
      to live&mdash;not precisely after the manner of a country landowner, nor
      precisely after the manner of a hermit. His days passed monotonously; but
      he was not bored though he saw no one; he set diligently and attentively
      to work at farming his estate, rode about the neighbourhood and did some
      reading. He read little, however; he found it pleasanter to listen to the
      tales of old Anton. Lavretsky usually sat at the window with a pipe and a
      cup of cold tea. Anton stood at the door, his hands crossed behind him,
      and began upon his slow, deliberate stories of old times, of those
      fabulous times when oats and rye were not sold by measure, but in great
      sacks, at two or three farthings a sack; when there were impassable
      forests, virgin steppes stretching on every side, even close to the town.
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; complained the old man, whose eightieth year had passed, &ldquo;there
      has been so much clearing, so much ploughing everywhere, there&rsquo;s nowhere
      you may drive now.&rdquo; Anton used to tell many stories, too, of his mistress,
      Glafira Petrovna; how prudent and saving she was; how a certain gentleman,
      a young neighbour, had paid her court, and used to ride over to see her,
      and how she was even pleased to put on her best cap, with ribbons of
      salmon colour, and her yellow gown of tru-tru levantine for him; but how,
      later on, she had been angry with the gentleman neighbour for his unseemly
      inquiry, &ldquo;What, madam, pray, might be your fortune?&rdquo; and had bade them
      refuse him the house; and how it was then that she had given directions
      that, after her decease, everything to the last rag should pass to Fedor
      Ivanitch. And, indeed, Lavretsky found all his aunt&rsquo;s household goods
      intact, not excepting the best cap with ribbons of salmon colour, and the
      yellow gown of tru-tru levantine. Of old papers and interesting documents,
      upon which Lavretsky had reckoned, there seemed no trace, except one old
      book, in which his grandfather, Piotr Andreitch, had inscribed in one
      place, &ldquo;Celebration in the city of Saint Petersburg of the peace,
      concluded with the Turkish empire by his Excellency Prince Alexander
      Alexandrovitch Prozorovsky;&rdquo; in another place a recipe for a pectoral
      decoction with the comment, &ldquo;This recipe was given to the general&rsquo;s lady,
      Prascovya Federovna Soltikov, by the chief priest of the Church of the
      Life-giving Trinity, Fedor Avksentyevitch:&rdquo; in another, a piece of
      political news of this kind: &ldquo;Somewhat less talk of the French tigers;&rdquo;
       and next this entry: &ldquo;In the Moscow Gazette an announcement of the death
      of Mr. Senior-Major Mihal Petrovitch Kolitchev. Is not this the son of
      Piotr Vassilyevitch Kolitchev? Lavretsky found also some old calendars and
      dream-books, and the mysterious work of Ambodik; many were the memories
      stirred by the well-known; but long-forgotten Symbols and Emblems. In
      Glafira Petrovna&rsquo;s little dressing-table, Lavretsky found a small packet,
      tied up with black ribbon, sealed with black sealing wax, and thrust away
      in the very farthest corner of the drawer. In the parcel there lay face to
      face a portrait, in pastel, of his father in his youth, with effeminate
      curls straying over his brow, with almond-shaped languid eyes and parted
      lips, and a portrait, almost effaced, of a pale woman in a white dress
      with a white rose in her hand&mdash;his mother. Of herself, Glafira
      Petrovna had never allowed a portrait to be taken. &ldquo;I, myself, little
      father, Fedor Ivanitch,&rdquo; Anton used to tell Lavretsky, &ldquo;though I did not
      then live in the master&rsquo;s house, still I can remember your
      great-grandfather, Andrey Afanasyevitch, seeing that I had come to my
      eighteenth year when he died. Once I met him in the garden and my knees!
      were knocking with fright indeed; however, he did nothing, only asked me
      my name, and sent me to his room for his pocket-handkerchief. He was a
      gentleman&mdash;how shall I tell you&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t look on any one as
      better than himself. For your great-grandfather had, I do assure you, a
      magic amulet; a monk from Mount Athos made him a present of this amulet.
      And he told him, this monk did, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your kindness, Boyar, I give you
      this; wear it, and you need not fear judgment.&rdquo; Well, but there, little
      father, we know what those times were like; what the master fancied doing,
      that he did. Sometimes, if even some gentleman saw fit to cross him in
      anything, he would just stare at him and say, &ldquo;You swim in shallow water;&rdquo;
       that was his favourite saying. And he lived, your great-grandfather of
      blessed memory, in a small log-house; and what goods he left behind him,
      what silver, and stores of all kinds! All the storehouses were full and
      overflowing. He was a manager. That very decanter, that you were pleased
      to admire, was his; he used to drink brandy out of it. But there was your
      grandfather, Piotr Andreitch, built himself a palace of stone, but he
      never grew rich; everything with him went badly, and he lived worse than
      his father by far, and he got no pleasure from it for himself, but spent
      all his money, and now there is nothing to remember him by&mdash;not a
      silver spoon has come down from him, and we have Glafira Petrovna&rsquo;s
      management to thank for all that is saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it true,&rdquo; Lavretsky interrupted him, &ldquo;they called her the old
      witch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of people called her so, I should like to know!&rdquo; replied Anton
      with an air of displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And little father,&rdquo; the old man one day found courage to ask, &ldquo;what about
      our mistress, where is she pleased to fix her residence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am separated from my wife,&rdquo; Lavretsky answered with an effort, &ldquo;please
      do not ask questions about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the old man mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three weeks had passed by, Lavretsky rode into O&mdash;&mdash;- to
      the Kalitins, and spent an evening with them. Lemm was there; Lavretsky
      took a great liking to him. Although thanks to his father, he played no
      instrument, he was passionately fond of music, real classical music.
      Panshin was not at the Kalitins&rsquo; that evening. The governor had sent him
      off to some place out of the town. Lisa played alone and very correct;
      Lemm woke up, got excited, twisted a piece of paper into a roll, and
      conducted. Marya Dmitrievna laughed at first, as she looked at him, later
      on she went off to bed; in her own words, Beethoven was too agitating for
      her nerves. At midnight Lavretsky accompanied Lemm to his lodging and
      stopped there with him till three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Lemm talked a
      great deal; his bent figure grew erect, his eyes opened wide and flashed
      fire; his hair even stood up on his forehead. It was so long since any one
      had shown him any sympathy, and Lavretsky was obviously interested in him,
      he was plying him with sympathetic and attentive questions. This touched
      the old man; he ended by showing the visitor his music, played and even
      sang in a faded voice some extracts from his works, among others the whole
      of Schiller&rsquo;s ballad, Fridolin, set by him to music. Lavretsky admired it,
      made him repeat some passages, and at parting, invited him to stay a few
      days with him. Lemm, as he accompanied him as far as the street, agreed at
      once, and warmly pressed his hand; but when he was left standing alone in
      the fresh, damp air, in the just dawning sunrise, he looked round him,
      shuddered, shrank into himself, and crept up to his little room, with a
      guilty air. &ldquo;Ich bin wohl nicht klug&rdquo; (I must be out of my senses), he
      muttered, as he lay down in his hard short bed. He tried to say that he
      was ill, a few days later, when Lavretsky drove over to fetch him in an
      open carriage; but Fedor Ivanitch went up into his room and managed to
      persuade him. What produced the most powerful effect upon Lemm was the
      circumstance that Lavretsky had ordered a piano from town to be sent into
      the country expressly for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set off together to the Kalitins&rsquo; and spent the evening with them,
      but not so pleasantly as on the last occasion. Panshin was there, he
      talked a great deal about his expedition, and very amusingly mimicked and
      described the country gentry he had seen; Lavretsky laughed, but Lemm
      would not come out of his corner, and sat silent, slightly tremulous all
      over like a spider, looking dull and sullen, and he only revived when
      Lavretsky began to take leave. Even when he was sitting in the carriage,
      the old man was still shy and constrained; but the warm soft air, the
      light breeze, and the light shadows, the scent of the grass and the
      birch-buds, the peaceful light of the starlit, moonless night, the
      pleasant tramp and snort of the horses&mdash;all the witchery of the
      roadside, the spring and the night, sank into the poor German&rsquo;s soul, and
      he was himself the first to begin a conversation with Lavretsky.

    </h2>
    <p>
      He began talking about music, about Lisa, then of music again. He seemed
      to enunciate his words more slowly when he spoke of Lisa. Lavretsky turned
      the conversation on his compositions, and half in jest, offered to write
      him a libretto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, a libretto!&rdquo; replied Lemm; &ldquo;no, that is not in my line; I have not
      now the liveliness, the play of the imagination, which is needed for an
      opera; I have lost too much of my power... But if I were still able to do
      something,&mdash;I should be content with a song; of course, I should like
      to have beautiful words...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking, and sat a long while motionless, his eyes lifted to
      the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;something in this way: &lsquo;Ye stars, ye
      pure stars!&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <p>
      Lavretsky turned his face slightly towards him and began to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye stars, pure stars,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Lemm... &ldquo;&lsquo;You look down upon the
      righteous and guilty alike.. but only the pure in heart,&rsquo;&mdash;or
      something of that kind&mdash;&lsquo;comprehend you&rsquo;&mdash;that is, no&mdash;&lsquo;love
      you.&rsquo; But I am not a poet. I&rsquo;m not equal to it! Something for that kind,
      though, something lofty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm pushed his hat on to the back of his head; in the dim twilight of the
      clear night his face looked paler and younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And you too,&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued, his voice gradually sinking, &ldquo;&lsquo;ye know who
      loves, who can love, because, pure ones, ye alone can comfort&rsquo;... No,
      that&rsquo;s not it at all! I am not a poet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but something of that
      sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I am not a poet,&rdquo; observed Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vain dreams!&rdquo; replied Lemm, and he buried himself in the corner of the
      carriage. He closed his eyes as though he were disposing himself to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few instants passed... Lavretsky listened... &ldquo;&lsquo;Stars, pure stars,
      love,&rsquo;&rdquo; muttered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; Lavretsky repeated to himself. He sank into thought&mdash;and his
      heart grew heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is beautiful music you have set to Fridolin, Christopher Fedoritch,&rdquo;
       he said aloud, &ldquo;but what do you suppose, did that Fridolin do, after the
      Count had presented him to his wife... became her lover, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so,&rdquo; replied Lemm, &ldquo;probably because experience,&rdquo;&mdash;he
      stopped suddenly and turned away in confusion. Lavretsky laughed
      constrainedly, and also turned away and began gazing at the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars had begun to grow paler and the sky had turned grey when the
      carriage drove up to the steps of the little house in Vassilyevskoe.
      Lavretsky conducted his guest to the room prepared for him, returned to
      his study and sat down before the window. In the garden a nightingale was
      singing its last song before dawn, Lavretsky remember that a nightingale
      had sung in the garden at the Kalitins&rsquo;; he remembered, too, the soft stir
      in Lisa&rsquo;s eyes, as at its first notes, they turned towards the dark
      window. He began to think of her, and his heart was calm again. &ldquo;Pure
      maiden,&rdquo; he murmured half-aloud: &ldquo;pure stars,&rdquo; he added with a smile, and
      went peacefully to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lemm sat a long while on his bed, a music-book on his knees. He felt
      as though sweet, unheard melody was haunting him; already he was all aglow
      and astir, already he felt the languor and sweetness of its presence.. but
      he could not reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither poet nor musician!&rdquo; he muttered at last... And his tired head
      sank wearily on to the pillows.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning the master of the house and his guest drank tea in the
      garden under an old time-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master!&rdquo; said Lavretsky among other things, &ldquo;you will soon have to
      compose a triumphal cantata.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what occasion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the nuptials of Mr. Panshin and Lisa. Did you notice what attention
      he paid her yesterday? It seems as though things were in a fair way with
      them already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will never be!&rdquo; cried Lemm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is impossible. Though, indeed,&rdquo; he added after a short pause,
      &ldquo;everything is possible in this world. Especially here among you in
      Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will leave Russia out of the question for a time; but what do you find
      amiss in this match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is amiss, everything. Lisaveta Mihalovna is a girl of high
      principles, serious, of lofty feelings, and he... he is a dilettante, in a
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose she loves him&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm got up from the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she does not love him, that is to say, she is very pure in heart, and
      does not know herself what it means... love. Madame von Kalitin tells her
      that he is a fine young man, and she obeys Madame von Kalitin because she
      is still quite a child, though she is nineteen; she says her prayers in
      the morning and in the evening&mdash;and that is very well; but she does
      not love him. She can only love what is beautiful, and he is not, that is,
      his soul is not beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm uttered this whole speech coherently, and with fire, walking with
      little steps to and fro before the tea-table, and running his eyes over
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest maestro!&rdquo; cried Lavretsky suddenly, &ldquo;it strikes me you are in
      love with cousin yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm stopped short all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you,&rdquo; he began in an uncertain voice, &ldquo;do not make fun of me like
      that. I am not crazy; I look towards the dark grave, not towards a rosy
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky felt sorry for the old man; he begged his pardon. After morning
      tea, Lemm played him his cantata, and after dinner, at Lavretsky&rsquo;s
      initiative, there was again talk of Lisa. Lavretsky listened to him with
      attention and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Christopher Fedoritch,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you see
      everything here seems in good order now, and the garden is in full bloom,
      couldn&rsquo;t we invite her over here for a day with her mother and my old
      aunt... eh? Would you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm bent his head over his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invite her,&rdquo; he murmured, scarcely audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Panshin isn&rsquo;t wanted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t wanted,&rdquo; rejoined the old man with an almost child-like
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Fedor Ivanitch set off to the town to see the Kalitins.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      He found them all at home, but he did not at once disclose his plan to
      them; he wanted to discuss it first with Lisa alone. Fortune favoured him;
      they were left alone in the drawing-room. They had some talk; she had had
      time by now to grow used to him&mdash;and she was not shy as a rule with
      any one. He listened to her, watched her, and mentally repeated Lemm&rsquo;s
      words, and agreed with them. It sometimes happens that two people who are
      acquainted, but not on intimate terms with one another, all of sudden grow
      rapidly more intimate in a few minutes, and the consciousness of this
      greater intimacy is at once expressed in their eyes, in their soft and
      affectionate smiles, and in their very gestures. This was exactly what
      came to pass with Lavretsky and Lisa. &ldquo;So he is like that,&rdquo; was her
      thought, as she turned a friendly glance on him; &ldquo;so you are like that,&rdquo;
       he too was thinking. And so he was not very much surprised when she
      informed him, not without a little faltering, however, that she had long
      wished to say something to him, but she was afraid of offending him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; tell me,&rdquo; he replied, and stood still before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa raised her clear eyes to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so good,&rdquo; she began, and at the same time, she thought: &ldquo;Yes, I
      am sure he is good&rdquo;... &ldquo;you will forgive me, I ought not dare to speak of
      it to you... but&mdash;how could you... why did you separate from your
      wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky shuddered: he looked at Lisa, and sat down near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I beg you, do not touch upon that wound; your hands
      are tender, but it will hurt me all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Lisa went on, as though she did not hear him, &ldquo;she has been to
      blame towards you. I don&rsquo;t want to defend her; but what God has joined,
      how can you put asunder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our convictions on that subject are too different, Lisaveta Mihalovna,&rdquo;
       Lavretsky observed, rather sharply; &ldquo;we cannot understand one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa grew paler: her whole frame was trembling slightly; but she was not
      silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive,&rdquo; she murmured softly, &ldquo;if you wish to be forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive!&rdquo; broke in Lavretsky. &ldquo;Ought you not first to know whom you are
      interceding for? Forgive that woman, take her back into my home, that
      empty, heartless creature! And who told you she wants to return to me? She
      is perfectly contented with her position, I can assure you... But what a
      subject to discuss here! Her name ought never to be uttered by you. You
      are too pure, you are not capable of understanding such a creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why abuse her?&rdquo; Lisa articulated with an effort. The trembling of her
      hands was perceptible now. &ldquo;You left her yourself, Fedor Ivanitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you,&rdquo; retorted Lavretsky with an involuntary outburst of
      impatience, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what that woman is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you marry her?&rdquo; whispered Lisa, and her eyes feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky got up quickly from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I marry her? I was young and inexperienced; I was deceived, I was
      carried away by a beautiful exterior. I knew no women. I knew nothing. God
      grant you may make a happier marriage! but let me tell you, you can be
      sure of nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too might be unhappy,&rdquo; said Lisa (her voice had begun to be unsteady),
      &ldquo;but then I ought to submit, I don&rsquo;t know how to say it; but if we do not
      submit&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky clenched his hands and stamped with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, forgive me,&rdquo; Lisa faltered hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Marya Dmitrievna came in. Lisa got up and was going away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; Lavretsky cried after her unexpectedly. &ldquo;I have a great
      favour to beg of your mother and you; to pay me a visit in my new abode.
      You know, I have had a piano sent over; Lemm is staying with me; the lilac
      is in flower now; you will get a breath of country air, and you can return
      the same day&mdash;will you consent?&rdquo; Lisa looked towards her mother;
      Marya Dmitrievna was assuming an expression of suffering; but Lavretsky
      did not give her time to open her mouth; he at once kissed both her hands.
      Marya Dmitrievna, who was always susceptible to demonstrations of feeling,
      and did not at all anticipate such effusivements from the &ldquo;dolt,&rdquo; was
      melted and gave her consent. While she was deliberating which day to fix,
      Lavretsky went up to Lisa, and, still greatly moved, whispered to her
      aside: &ldquo;Thank you, you are a good girl; I was to blame.&rdquo; And her pale face
      glowed with a bright, shy smile; her eyes smiled too&mdash;up to that
      instant she had been afraid she had offended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vladimir Nikolaitch can come with us?&rdquo; inquired Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lavretsky, &ldquo;but would it not be better to be just a family
      party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, it seems,&rdquo; began Marya Dmitrievna. &ldquo;But as you please,&rdquo;
       she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided to take Lenotchka and Shurotchka. Marfa Timofyevna refused
      to join in the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard for me, my darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to give my old bones a
      shaking; and to be sure there&rsquo;s nowhere for me to sleep at your place:
      besides, I can&rsquo;t sleep in a strange bed. Let the young folks go
      frolicking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky did not succeed in being alone again with Lisa; but he looked at
      her in such a way that she felt her heart at rest, and a little ashamed,
      and sorry for him. He pressed her hand warmly at parting; left alone, she
      fell to musing.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Lavretsky reached home, he was met at the door of the drawing-room by
      a tall, thin man, in a thread-bare blue coat, with a wrinkled, but lively
      face, with disheveled grey whiskers, a long straight nose, and small fiery
      eyes. This was Mihalevitch, who had been his friend at the university.
      Lavretsky did not at first recognise him, but embraced him warmly directly
      he told his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not met since their Moscow days. Torrents of exclamations and
      questions followed; long-buried recollections were brought to light.
      Hurriedly smoking pipe after pipe, tossing off tea at a gulp, and
      gesticulating with his long hands, Mihalevitch related his adventures to
      Lavretsky; there was nothing very inspiriting in them, he could not boast
      of success in his undertakings&mdash;but he was constantly laughing a
      hoarse, nervous laugh. A month previously he had received a position in
      the private counting-house of a spirit-tax contractor, two hundred and
      fifty miles from the town of O&mdash;&mdash;-, and hearing of Lavretsky
      returned from abroad he had turned out of his way so as to see his old
      friend. Mihalevitch and talked as impetuously as in his youth; made as
      much noise and was as effervescent as of old. Lavretsky was about to
      acquaint him with his new position, but Mihalevitch interrupted him,
      muttering hurriedly, &ldquo;I have heard, my dear fellow, I have heard&mdash;who
      could have anticipated it?&rdquo; and at once turned the conversation upon
      general subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must set off to-morrow, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;to-day if you
      will excuse it, we will sit up late. I want above all to know what you are
      like, what are your views and convictions, what you have become, what life
      has taught you.&rdquo; (Mihalevitch still preserved the phraseology of 1830.)
      &ldquo;As for me, I have changed in much; the waves of life have broken over my
      breast&mdash;who was it said that?&mdash;though in what is important,
      essential I have not changed; I believe as of old in the good, the true:
      but I do not only believe&mdash;I have faith now, yes, I have faith,
      faith. Listen, you know I write verses; there is no poetry in them, but
      there is truth. I will read you aloud my last poem; I have expressed my
      truest convictions in it. Listen.&rdquo; Mihalevitch fell to reading his poem:
      it was rather long, and ended with the following lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I gave myself to new feelings with all my heart,
    And my soul became as a child&rsquo;s!
    And I have burnt all I adored
    And now adore all that I burnt.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As he uttered the two last lines, Mihalevitch all but shed tears; a slight
      spasm&mdash;the sign of deep emotion&mdash;passed over his wide mouth, his
      ugly face lighted up. Lavretsky listened, and listened to him&mdash;and
      the spirit of antagonism was aroused in him; he was irritated by the
      ever-ready enthusiasm of the Moscow student, perpetually at boiling-point.
      Before a quarter of an hour had elapsed a heated argument had broken out
      between them, one of these endless arguments, of which only Russians are
      capable. After a separation of many years spent in two different worlds,
      with no clear understanding of the other&rsquo;s ideas or even of their own,
      catching at words and replying only in words, they disputed about the most
      abstract subjects, and they disputed as though it were a matter of life
      and death for both: they shouted and vociferated so that every one in the
      house was startled, and poor Lemm, who had locked himself up in his room
      directly after Mihalevitch arrived, was bewildered, and began even to feel
      vaguely alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you after all? a pessimist?&rdquo; cried Mihalevitch at one o&rsquo;clock in
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are pessimists usually like this?&rdquo; replied Lavretsky. &ldquo;They are usually
      all pale and sickly&mdash;would you like me to lift you with one hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you are not a pessimist you are a scepteec, that&rsquo;s still worse.&rdquo;
       Mihalevitch&rsquo;s talk had a strong flavour of his mother-country, Little
      Russia. &ldquo;And what right have you to be a scepteec? You have had ill-luck
      in life, let us admit; that was not your fault; you were born with a
      passionate loving heart, and you were unnaturally kept out of the society
      of women: the first woman you came across was bound to deceive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She deceived you too,&rdquo; observed Lavretsky grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted, granted; I was the tool of destiny in it&mdash;what nonsense I
      talk, though&mdash;there is no such thing as destiny; it is an old habit
      of expressing things inexactly. But what does that prove?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It proves this, that they distorted me from my childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s for you to straighten yourself! What&rsquo;s the good of being a
      man, a male animal? And however that may be, is it possible, is it
      permissible, to reduce a personal, so to speak, fact to a general law, to
      an infallible principle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How a principle?&rdquo; interrupted Lavretsky; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is your principle, your principle,&rdquo; Mihalevitch interrupted in his
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an egoist, that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo; he was thundering an hour later:
      &ldquo;you wanted personal happiness, you wanted enjoyment in life, you wanted
      to live only for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by personal happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And everything deceived you; everything crumbled away under your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by personal happiness, I ask you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was bound to crumble away. Either you sought support where it
      could not be found, or you built your house on shifting sands, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak more plainly, or I can&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or&mdash;you may laugh if you like&mdash;or you had no faith, no warmth
      of heart; intellect, nothing but one farthing&rsquo;s worth of intellect... you
      are simply a pitiful, antiquated Voltairean, that&rsquo;s what you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Voltairean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like your father, and you yourself do not suspect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that,&rdquo; exclaimed Lavretsky, &ldquo;I have the right to call you a
      fanatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied Mihalevitch with a contrite air, &ldquo;I have not so far
      deserved such an exalted title, unhappily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out now what to call you,&rdquo; cried the same Mihalevitch, at
      three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. &ldquo;You are not a sceptic, nor a pessimist, nor
      a Voltairean, you are a loafer, and you are a vicious loafer, a conscious
      loafer, not a simple loafer. Simple loafers lie on the stove and do
      nothing because they don&rsquo;t know how to do anything; they don&rsquo;t think about
      anything either, but you are a man of ideas&mdash;and yet you lie on the
      stove; you could do something&mdash;and you do nothing; you lie idle with
      a full stomach and look down from above and say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s best to lie idle
      like this, because whatever people do, is all rubbish, leading to
      nothing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from what do you infer that I lie idle?&rdquo; Lavretsky protested stoutly.
      &ldquo;Why do you attribute such ideas to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, besides that, you are all, all the tribe of you,&rdquo; continued
      Mihalevitch, &ldquo;cultivated loafers. You know which leg the German limps on,
      you know what&rsquo;s amiss with the English and the French, and your pitiful
      culture goes to make it worse, your shameful idleness, your abominable
      inactivity is justified by it. Some are even proud of it: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m such a
      clever fellow,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;I do nothing, while these fools are in a fuss.&rsquo; 
      Yes! and there are fine gentlemen among us&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t say this
      as to you&mdash;who reduce their whole life to a kind of stupor of
      boredom, get used to it, live in it, like&mdash;like a mushroom in white
      sauce,&rdquo; Mihalevitch added hastily, and he laughed at his own comparison.
      &ldquo;Oh! this stupor of boredom is the ruin of Russians. Ours is the age for
      work, and the sickening loafer&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is all this abuse about?&rdquo; Lavretsky clamoured in his turn. &ldquo;Work&mdash;doing&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      better say what is to be done, instead of abusing me, Desmosthenes of
      Poltava!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, what a thing to ask! I can&rsquo;t tell you that brother; that every one
      ought to know for himself,&rdquo; retorted the Desmosthenes ironically. &ldquo;A
      landowner, a nobleman, and not know what to do? You have no faith, or else
      you would know; no faith&mdash;and no intuition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me at least have time to breathe; you don&rsquo;t let me have time to look
      round,&rdquo; Lavretsky besought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a minute, nor a second!&rdquo; retorted Mihalevitch with an imperious wave
      of the hand. &ldquo;Not one second: death does not delay, and life ought not to
      delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a time, what a place for men to think of loafing!&rdquo; he cried at
      four o&rsquo;clock, in a voice, however, which showed signs of sleepiness;
      &ldquo;among us! now! in Russia where every separate individual has a duty
      resting upon him, a solemn responsibility to God, to the people, to
      himself. We are sleeping, and the time is slipping away; we are
      sleeping.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to observe,&rdquo; remarked Lavretsky, &ldquo;that we are not sleeping at
      present but rather preventing others from sleeping. We are straining our
      throats like the cocks&mdash;listen! there is one crowing for the third
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sally made Mihalevitch laugh, and calmed him down. &ldquo;Good-bye till
      to-morrow,&rdquo; he said with a smile, and thrust his pipe into his pouch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till to-morrow,&rdquo; repeated Lavretsky. But the friends talked for more than
      hour longer. Their voices were no longer raised, however, and their talk
      was quiet, sad, friendly talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mihalevitch set off the next day, in spite of all Lavretsky&rsquo;s efforts to
      keep him. Fedor Ivanitch did not succeed in persuading him to remain; but
      he talked to him to his heart&rsquo;s content. Mihalevitch, it appeared, had not
      a penny to bless himself with. Lavretsky had noticed with pain the evening
      before all the tokens and habits of years of poverty; his boots were
      shabby, a button was off on the back of his coat, on his arrival, he had
      not even thought of asking to wash, and at supper he ate like a shark,
      tearing his meat in his fingers, and crunching the bones with his strong
      black teeth. It appeared, too, that he had made nothing out of his
      employment, that he now rested all his hopes on the contractor who was
      taking him solely in order to have an &ldquo;educated man&rdquo; in his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that Mihalevitch was not discouraged, but as idealist or cynic,
      lived on a crust of bread, sincerely rejoicing or grieving over the
      destinies of humanity, and his own vocation, and troubling himself very
      little as to how to escape dying of hunger. Mihalevitch was not married:
      but had been in love times beyond number, and had written poems to all the
      objects of his adoration; he sang with especial fervour the praises of a
      mysterious black-tressed &ldquo;noble Polish lady.&rdquo; There were rumours, it is
      true, that this &ldquo;noble Polish lady&rdquo; was a simple Jewess, very well known
      to a good many cavalry officers&mdash;but, after all, what do you think&mdash;does
      it really make any difference?
    </p>
    <p>
      With Lemm, Mihalevitch did not get on; his noisy talk and brusque manners
      scared the German, who was unused to such behaviour. One poor devil
      detects another by instinct at once, but in old age he rarely gets on with
      him, and that is hardly astonishing, he has nothing to share with him, not
      even hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before setting off, Mihalevitch had another long discussion with
      Lavretsky, foretold his ruin, if he did not see the error of his ways,
      exhorted him to devote himself seriously to the welfare of his peasants,
      and pointed to himself as an example, saying that he had been purified in
      the furnace of suffering; and in the same breath called himself several
      times a happy man, comparing himself with the fowl of the air and the lily
      of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A black lily, any way,&rdquo; observed Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, brother, don&rsquo;t be a snob!&rdquo; retorted Mihalevitch, good-naturedly, &ldquo;but
      thank God rather there is a pure plebeian blood in your veins too. But I
      see that you want some pure, heavenly creature to draw you out of your
      apathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, brother,&rdquo; remarked Lavretsky. &ldquo;I have had quite enough of those
      heavenly creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, ceeneec!&rdquo; cried Mihalevitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynic,&rdquo; Lavretsky corrected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ceeneec, just so,&rdquo; repeated Mihalevitch unabashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when he had taken his seat in the carriage, to which his flat,
      yellow, strangely light trunk was carried, he still talked; muffled in a
      kind of Spanish cloak with a collar, brown with age, and a clasp of two
      lion&rsquo;s paws; he went on developing his views on the destiny of Russian,
      and waving his swarthy hand in the air, as though he were sowing the seeds
      of her future prosperity. The horses started at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember my three last words,&rdquo; he cried, thrusting his whole body out of
      the carriage and balancing so, &ldquo;Religion, progress, humanity!...
      Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head, with a foraging cap pulled down over his eyes, disappeared.
      Lavretsky was left standing alone on the steps, and he gazed steadily into
      the distance along the road till the carriage disappeared out of sight.
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is right, after all,&rdquo; he thought as he went back into the
      house; &ldquo;perhaps I am a loafer.&rdquo; Many of Mihalevitch&rsquo;s words had sunk
      irresistibly into his heart, though he had disputed and disagreed with
      him. If a man only has a good heart, no one can resist him.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days later, Marya Dmitrievna visited Vassilyevskoe according to her
      promise, with all her young people. The little girls ran at once into the
      garden, while Marya Dmitrievna languidly walked through the rooms and
      languidly admired everything. She regarded her visit to Lavretsky as a
      sign of great condescension, almost as a deed of charity. She smiled
      graciously when Anton and Apraxya kissed her hand in the old-fashioned
      house-servants&rsquo; style; and in a weak voice, speaking through her nose,
      asked for some tea. To the great vexation of Anton, who had put on knitted
      white gloves for the purpose, tea was not handed to the grand lady visitor
      by him, but by Lavretsky&rsquo;s hired valet, who in the old man&rsquo;s words, had
      not a notion of what was proper. To make up for this, Anton resumed his
      rights at dinner: he took up a firm position behind Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s
      chair; and he would not surrender his post to any one. The appearance of
      guests after so long an interval at Vassilyevskoe fluttered and delighted
      the old man. It was a pleasure to him to see that his master was
      acquainted with such fine gentlefolk. He was not, however, the only one
      who was fluttered that day; Lemm, too, was in agitation. He had put on a
      rather short snuff-coloured coat with a swallow-tail, and tied his neck
      handkerchief stiffly, and he kept incessantly coughing and making way for
      people with a cordial and affable air. Lavretsky noticed with pleasure
      that his relations with Lisa were becoming more intimate; she had held out
      her hand to him affectionately directly she came in. After dinner Lemm
      drew out of his coat-tail pocket, into which he had continually been
      fumbling, a small roll of music-paper and compressing his lips he laid it
      without speaking on the pianoforte. It was a song composed by him the
      evening before, to some old-fashioned German words, in which mention was
      made of the stars. Lisa sat down at once to the piano and played at sight
      the song.... Alas! the music turned out to be complicated and painfully
      strained; it was clear that the composer had striven to express something
      passionate and deep, but nothing had come of it; the effort had remained
      an effort. Lavretsky and Lisa both felt this, and Lemm understood it.
      Without uttering a single word, he put his song back into his pocket, and
      in reply to Lisa&rsquo;s proposal to play it again, he only shook his head and
      said significantly: &ldquo;Now&mdash;enough!&rdquo; and shrinking into himself he
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening the whole party went out to fish. In the pond behind the
      garden there were plenty of carp and groundlings. Marya Dmitrievna was put
      in an arm-chair near the banks, in the shade, with a rug under her feet
      and the best line was given to her. Anton as an old experienced angler
      offered her his services. He zealously put on the worms, and clapped his
      hand on them, spat on them and even threw in the line with a graceful
      forward swing of his whole body. Marya Dmitrievna spoke of him the same
      day to Fedor Ivanitch in the following phrase, in boarding-school French:
      &ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a plus maintenant de ces gens comme ca, comme autrefois.&rdquo; Lemm
      with the two little girls went off further to the dam of the pond;
      Lavretsky took up his position near Lisa. The fish were continually
      biting, the carp were constantly flashing in the air with golden and
      silvery sides as they were drawn in; the cries of pleasure of the little
      girls were incessant, even Marya Dmitrievna uttered a little feminine
      shriek on two occasions. The fewest fish were caught by Lavretsky and
      Lisa; probably this was because they paid less attention than the others
      to the angling, and allowed their floats to swim back right up to the
      bank. The high reddish reeds rustled quietly around, the still water shone
      quietly before them, and quietly too they talked together. Lisa was
      standing on a small raft; Lavretsky sat on the inclined trunk of a willow;
      Lisa wore a white gown, tied round the waist with a broad ribbon, also
      white; her straw hat was hanging on one hand, and in the other with some
      effort she held up the crooked rod. Lavretsky gazed at her pure, somewhat
      severe profile, at her hair drawn back behind her ears, at her soft
      cheeks, which glowed like a little child&rsquo;s, and thought, &ldquo;Oh, how sweet
      you are, bending over my pond!&rdquo; Lisa did not turn to him, but looked at
      the water, half frowning, to keep the sun out of her eyes, half smiling.
      The shade of the lime-tree near fell upon both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; began Lavretsky, &ldquo;I have been thinking over our last
      conversation a great deal, and have come to the conclusion that you are
      exceedingly good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not at all my intention in&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; Lisa was beginning to
      reply, and she was overcome with embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are good,&rdquo; repeated Lavretsky. &ldquo;I am a rough fellow, but I feel that
      every one must love you. There&rsquo;s Lemm for instance; he is simply in love
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa&rsquo;s brows did not exactly frown, they contracted slightly; it always
      happened with her when she heard something disagreeable to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very sorry for him to-day,&rdquo; Lavretsky added, &ldquo;with his unsuccessful
      song. To be young and to fail is bearable; but to be old and not be
      successful is hard to bear. And how mortifying it is to feel that one&rsquo;s
      forces are deserting one! It is hard for an old man to bear such blows!...
      Be careful, you have a bite.... They say,&rdquo; added Lavretsky after a short
      pause, &ldquo;that Vladimir Nikolaitch has written a very pretty song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lisa, &ldquo;it is only a trifle, but not bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think,&rdquo; inquired Lavretsky; &ldquo;is he a good musician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has great talent for music; but so far he has not worked at
      it, as he should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And is he a good sort of man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa laughed and glanced quickly at Fedor Ivanitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a queer question!&rdquo; she exclaimed, drawing up her line and throwing
      it in again further off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it queer? I ask you about him, as one who has only lately come
      here, as a relation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A relation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am, it seems, a sort of uncle of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vladimir Nikolaitch has a good heart,&rdquo; said Lisa, &ldquo;and he is clever;
      maman likes him very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is nice; why should I not like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Lavretsky uttered and ceased speaking. A half-mournful,
      half-ironical expression passed over his face. His steadfast gaze
      embarrassed Lisa, but he went on smiling.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, God grant them
      happiness!&rdquo; he muttered at last, as though to himself, and turned away his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Fedor Ivanitch,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;you are wrong in thinking
      .... But don&rsquo;t you like Vladimir Nikolaitch?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has no heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile left Lisa&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your habit to judge people severely,&rdquo; she observed after a long
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is. What right have I to judge others severely, do you
      suppose, when I must ask for indulgency myself? Or have you forgotten that
      I am a laughing stock to everyone, who is not too indifferent even to
      scoff?... By the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;did you keep your promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you pray for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I prayed for you, and I pray for you every day. But please do not
      speak lightly of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky began to assure Lisa that the idea of doing so had never entered
      his head, that he had the deepest reverence for every conviction; then he
      went off into a discourse upon religion, its significance in the history
      of mankind, the significance of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must be a Christian,&rdquo; observed Lisa, not without some effort, &ldquo;not so
      as to know the divine... and the... earthly, because every man has to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky raised his eyes in involuntary astonishment upon Lisa and met
      her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a strange saying you have just uttered!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my saying,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yours.... But what made you speak of death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I often think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would not suppose so, looking at you now; you have such a bright,
      happy face, you are smiling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am very happy just now,&rdquo; replied Lisa simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky would have liked to seize both her hands, and press them warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa, Lisa!&rdquo; cried Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;do come here, and look what a fine
      carp I have caught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a minute, maman,&rdquo; replied Lisa, and went towards her, but Lavretsky
      remained sitting on his willow. &ldquo;I talk to her just as if life were not
      over for me,&rdquo; he thought. As she went away, Lisa hung her hat on a twig;
      with strange, almost tender emotion, Lavretsky looked at the hat, and its
      long rather crumpled ribbons. Lisa soon came back to him, and again took
      her stand on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think Vladimir Nikolaitch has no heart?&rdquo; she asked a few
      minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you already that I may be mistaken; time will show, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa grew thoughtful. Lavretsky began to tell her about his daily life at
      Vassilyevskoe, about Mihalevitch, and about Anton; he felt a need to talk
      to Lisa, to share with her everything that was passing in his heart; she
      listened so sweetly, so attentively; her few replies and observations
      seemed to him so simple and so intelligent. He even told her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I thought that I was like my maid, Nastya; I had no
      words of my own. She said one day to her sweetheart: &lsquo;You must be dull
      with me; you always talk so finely to me, and I have no words of my own.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thank God for it!&rdquo; thought Lavretsky.

    <p>
      Meanwhile the evening had come on, Marya Dmitrievna expressed a desire to
      return home, and the little girls were with difficulty torn away from the
      pond, and made ready. Lavretsky declared that he would escort his guests
      half-way, and ordered his horse to be saddled. As he was handing Marya
      Dmitrievna into the coach, he bethought himself of Lemm; but the old man
      could nowhere be found. He had disappeared directly after the angling was
      over. Anton, with an energy remarkable for his years, slammed the doors,
      and called sharply, &ldquo;Go on, coachman!&rdquo; the coach started. Marya Dmitrievna
      and Lisa were seated in the back seat; the children and their maid in the
      front. The evening was warm and still, and the windows were open on both
      sides. Lavretsky trotted near the coach on the side of Lisa, with his arm
      leaning on the door&mdash;he had thrown the reigns on the neck of his
      smoothly-pacing horse&mdash;and now and then he exchanged a few words with
      the young girl. The glow of sunset was! disappearing; night came on, but
      the air seemed to grow even warmer. Marya Dmitrievna was soon slumbering,
      the little girls and the maid fell asleep also. The coach rolled swiftly
      and smoothly along; Lisa was bending forward, she felt happy; the rising
      moon lighted up her face, the fragrant night on breeze breathed on her
      eyes and cheeks. Her hand rested on the coach door near Lavretsky&rsquo;s hand.
      And he was happy; borne along in the still warmth of the night, never
      taking his eyes off the good young face, listening to the young voice that
      was melodious even in a whisper, as it spoke of simple, good things, he
      did not even notice that he had gone more than half-way. He did not want
      to wake Marya Dmitrievna, he lightly pressed Lisa&rsquo;s hand and said, &ldquo;I
      think we are friends now, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; She nodded, he stopped his horse,
      and the coach rolled away, lightly swaying and oscillating up and down;
      Lavretsky turned homeward at a walking pace. The witchery of the summer
      night enfolded him; all around him seemed suddenly so strange&mdash;and at
      the same time so long known; so sweetly familiar. Everywhere near and afar&mdash;and
      one could see in to the far distance, though the eye could not make out
      clearly much of what was seen&mdash;all was at peace; youthful, blossoming
      life seemed expressed in this deep peace. Lavretsky&rsquo;s horse stepped out
      bravely, swaying evenly to right and left; its great black shadow moved
      along beside it. There was something strangely sweet in the tramp of its
      hoofs, a strange charm in the ringing cry of the quails. The stars were
      lost in a bright mist; the moon, not yet at the full, shone with steady
      brilliance; its light was shot in an azure stream over the sky, and fell
      in patches of smoky gold on the thin clouds as they drifted near. The
      freshness of the air drew a slight moisture into the eyes, sweetly folded
      all the limbs, and flowed freely into the lungs. Lavretsky rejoiced in it,
      and was glad at his own rejoicing. &ldquo;Come, we are still alive,&rdquo; he thought;
      &ldquo;we have not been altogether destroyed by&rdquo;&mdash;he did not say&mdash;by
      whom or by what. Then he fell to thinking of Lisa, that she could hardly
      love Panshin, that if he had met her under different circumstances&mdash;God
      knows what might have come of it; that he undertook Lemm though Lisa had
      no words of &ldquo;her own:&rdquo; but that, he thought, was not true; she had words
      of her own. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak light of that,&rdquo; came back to Lavretsky&rsquo;s mind. He
      rode a long way with his head bent in thought, then drawing himself up, he
      slowly repeated aloud:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;And I have burnt all I adored,
    And now I adore all that I burnt.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then he gave his horse a switch with the whip, and galloped all the way
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismounting from his horse, he looked round for the last time with an
      involuntary smile of gratitude. Night, still, kindly night stretched over
      hills and valleys; from afar, out of its fragrant depths&mdash;God knows
      whence&mdash;whether from the heavens or the earth&mdash;rose a soft,
      gentle warmth. Lavretsky sent a last greeting to Lisa, and ran up the
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day passed rather dully. Rain was falling from early morning;
      Lemm wore a scowl, and kept more and more tightly compressing his lips, as
      though he had taken an oath never to open them again. When he went to his
      room, Lavretsky took up to bed with him a whole bundle of French
      newspapers, which had been lying for more than fortnight on his table
      unopened. He began indifferently to tear open the wrappings, and glanced
      hastily over the columns of the newspapers&mdash;in which, however, there
      was nothing new. He was just about to throw them down&mdash;and all at
      once he leaped out of bed as if he had been stung. In an article in one of
      the papers, M. Jules, with whom we are already familiar, communicated to
      his readers a &ldquo;mournful intelligence, that charming, fascinating Moscow
      lady,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;one of the queens of fashion, who adorned Parisian
      salons, Madame de Lavretsky, had died almost suddenly, and this
      intelligence, unhappily only too well-founded, had only just reached him,
      M. Jules. He was,&rdquo; so he continued, &ldquo;he might say a friend of the
      deceased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky dressed, went out into the garden, and till morning he walked up
      and down the same path.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, over their tea, Lemm asked Lavretsky to let him have the
      horses to return to town. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to set to work, that is, to my
      lessons,&rdquo; observed the old man. &ldquo;Besides, I am only wasting time here.&rdquo;
       Lavretsky did not reply at once; he seemed abstracted. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he
      said at last; &ldquo;I will come with you myself.&rdquo; Unaided by the servants,
      Lemm, groaning and wrathful, packed his small box and tore up and burnt a
      few sheets of music-paper. The horses were harnessed. As he came out of
      his own room, Lavretsky put the paper he had read last night in his
      pocket. During the whole course of the journey both Lemm and Lavretsky
      spoke little to one another; each was occupied with his own thoughts, and
      each was glad not to be disturbed by the other; and they parted rather
      coolly; which is often the way, however, with friends in Russia. Lavretsky
      conducted the old man to his little house; the latter got out, took his
      trunk and without holding out his hand to his friend (he was holding his
      trunk in both arms before his breast), without even looking at him, he
      said to him in Russian, &ldquo;good-bye!&rdquo; &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; repeated Lavretsky, and
      bade the coachman drive to his lodging. He had taken rooms in the town of
      O&mdash;&mdash;-... After writing a few letters and hastily dining,
      Lavretsky went to the Kalitins&rsquo;. In their drawing-room he found only
      Panshin, who informed him that Marya Dmitrievna would be in directly, and
      at once, with charming cordiality, entered into conversation with him.
      Until that day, Panshin had always treated Lavretsky, not exactly
      haughtily, but at least condescendingly; but Lisa, in describing her
      expedition of the previous day to Panshin, had spoken of Lavretsky as an
      excellent and clever man, that was enough; he felt bound to make a
      conquest of an &ldquo;excellent man.&rdquo; Panshin began with compliments to
      Lavretsky, with a description of the rapture in which, according to him,
      the whole family of Marya Dmitrievna! spoke of Vassilyevskoe; and then,
      according to his custom, passing neatly to himself, began to talk about
      his pursuits, and his views on life, the world and government service;
      uttered a sentence or two upon the future of Russia, and the duty of
      rulers to keep a strict hand over the country; and at this point laughed
      light-heartedly at his own expense, and added that among other things he
      had been intrusted in Petersburg with the duty de poplariser l&rsquo;idee du
      cadastre. He spoke somewhat at length, passing over all difficulties with
      careless self-confidence, and playing with the weightiest administrative
      and political questions, as a juggler plays with balls. The expressions:
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I would do if I were in the government;&rdquo; &ldquo;you as a man of
      intelligence, will agree with me at once,&rdquo; were constantly on his lips.
      Lavretsky listened coldly to Panshin&rsquo;s chatter; he did not like this
      handsome, clever, easily-elegant young man, with his bright smile, affable
      voice, and inquisitive eyes. Panshin, with the quick insight into the
      feelings of others, which was peculiar to him, soon guessed that he was
      not giving his companion any special satisfaction, and made a plausible
      excuse to go away, inwardly deciding that Lavretsky might be an &ldquo;excellent
      man,&rdquo; but he was unattractive, aigri, and, en somme, rather absurd. Marya
      Dmitrievna made her appearance escorted by Gedeonovsky, then Marfa
      Timofyevna and Lisa came in; and after them the other members of the
      household; and then the musical amateur, Madame Byelenitsin, arrived, a
      little thinnish lady, with a languid, pretty, almost childish little face,
      wearing a rusting dress, a striped fan, and heavy gold bracelets. Her
      husband was with her, a fat red-faced man, with large hands and feet,
      white eye-lashes, and an immovable smile on his thick lips; his wife never
      spoke to him in company, but at home, in moments of tenderness, she used
      to call him her little sucking-pig. Panshin returned; the rooms were very
      full of people and noise. Such a crowd was not to Lavretsky&rsquo;s taste; and
      he was particularly irritated by Madame Byelenitsin, who kept staring at
      him through her eye-glasses. He would have gone away at once but for Lisa;
      he wanted to say a few words to her alone, but for a long time he could
      not get a favourable opportunity, and had to content himself with
      following her in secret delight with his eyes; never had her face seemed
      sweeter and more noble to him. She gained much from being near Madame
      Byelenitsin. The latter was for ever fidgeting in her chair, shrugging her
      narrow shoulders, giving little girlish giggles, and screwing up her eyes
      and then opening them wide; Lisa sat quietly, looked directly at every one
      and did not laugh at all. Madame Kalitin sat down to a game of cards with
      Marfa Timofyevna, Madame Byelenitsin, and Gedeonovsky, who played very
      slowly, and constantly made mistakes, frowning and wiping his face with
      his handkerchief. Panshin assumed a melancholy air, and expressed himself
      in brief, pregnant, and gloomy phrases, played the part, in fact, of the
      unappreciated genius, but in spite of the entreaties of Madame
      Byelenitsin, who was very coquettish with him, he would not consent to
      sing his son; he felt Lavretsky&rsquo;s presence a constraint. Fedor Ivanitch
      also spoke little the peculiar expression of his face struck Lisa directly
      he came into the room; she felt at once that he had something to tell her,
      and though she could not herself have said why, she was afraid to question
      him. At last, as she was going into the next room to pour out tea, she
      involuntarily turned her head in his direction. He at once went after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she said, setting the teapot on the samovar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, have you noticed anything?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not the same to-day as I have always seen you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky bent over the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;to tell you a piece of news, but now it is
      impossible. However, you can read what is marked with pencil in that
      article,&rdquo; he added, handing her the paper he had brought with him. &ldquo;Let me
      ask you to keep it a secret; I will come to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa was greatly bewildered. Panshin appeared in the doorway. She put the
      newspaper in her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read Obermann, Lisaveta Mihalovna?&rdquo; Panshin asked her pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa made him a reply in passing, and went out of the room and up-stairs.
      Lavretsky went back to the drawing-room and drew near the card-table.
      Marfa Timofyevna, flinging back the ribbons of her cap and flushing with
      annoyance, began to complain of her partner, Gedeonovsky, who in her
      words, could not play a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Car-playing, you see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is not so easy as talking scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter continued to blink and wipe his face. Lisa came into the
      drawing-room and sat down in a corner; Lavretsky looked at her, she looked
      at him, and both the felt the position insufferable. He read perplexity
      and a kind of secret reproachfulness in her face. He could not talk to her
      as he would have liked to do; to remain in the same room with her, a guest
      among other guests, was too painful; he decided to go away. As he took
      leave of her, he managed to repeat that he would come to-morrow, and added
      that he trusted in her friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she answered with the same perplexity on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panshin brightened up at Lavretsky&rsquo;s departure: he began to give advice to
      Gedeonovsky, paid ironical attentions to Madame Byelenitsin, and at last
      sang his song. But with Lisa he still spoke and looked as before,
      impressively and rather mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Lavretsky did not sleep all night. He was not sad, he was not
      agitated, he was quite clam; but he could not sleep. He did not even
      remember the past; he simply looked at his life; his heart beat slowly and
      evenly; the hours glided by; he did not even think of sleep. Only at times
      the thought flashed through his brain: &ldquo;But it is not true, it is all
      nonsense,&rdquo; and he stood still, bowed his head and again began to ponder on
      the life before him.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna did not give Lavretsky an over-cordial welcome when he
      made his appearance the following day. &ldquo;Upon my word, he&rsquo;s always in and
      out,&rdquo; she thought. She did not much care for him, and Panshin, under whose
      influence she was, had been very artful and disparaging in his praises of
      him the evening before. And as she did not regard him as a visitor, and
      did not consider it necessary to entertain a relation, almost one of the
      family, it came to pass that in less than half-an hour&rsquo;s time he found
      himself walking in an avenue in the grounds with Lisa. Lenotchka and
      Shurotchka were running about a few paces from them in the flower-garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa was as calm as usual but more than usually pale. She took out of her
      pocket and held out to Lavretsky the sheet of the newspaper folded up
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is terrible!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps it is not true, though,&rdquo; added Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I asked you not to speak of it to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa walked on a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she began: &ldquo;you are not grieved? not at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know myself what I feel,&rdquo; replied Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you loved her once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are not grieved at her death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was dead to me long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sinful to say that. Do not be angry with me. You call me your
      friend: a friend may say everything. To me it is really terrible....
      Yesterday there was an evil look in your face.... Do you remember not long
      ago how you abused her, and she, perhaps, at that very time was dead? It
      is terrible. It has been sent to you as a punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky smiled bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? At least, I am now free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa gave a slight shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, do not talk like that. Of what use is your freedom to you? You
      ought not to be thinking of that now, but of forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgave her long ago,&rdquo; Lavretsky interposed with a gesture of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is not it,&rdquo; replied Lisa, flushing. &ldquo;You did not understand me.
      You ought to be seeking to be forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be forgiven by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom? God. Who can forgive us, but God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky seized her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Lisaveta Mihalovna, believe me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I have been punished
      enough as it is. I have expiated everything already, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you cannot know,&rdquo; Lisa murmured in an undertone. &ldquo;You have forgotten&mdash;not
      long ago, when you were talking to me&mdash;you were not ready to forgive
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked in silence along the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about your daughter?&rdquo; Lisa asked, suddenly stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be uneasy! I have already sent letters in all directions. The
      future of my daughter, as you call&mdash;as you say&mdash;is assured. Do
      not be uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa smiled mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are right,&rdquo; continued Lavretsky, &ldquo;what can I do with my freedom?
      What good is it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you get that paper?&rdquo; said Lisa, without replying to his
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day after your visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it possible you did not even shed tears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I was thunderstruck; but where were tears to come from? Should I weep
      over the past? but it is utterly extinct for me! Her very fault did not
      destroy my happiness, but only showed me that it had never been at all.
      What is there to weep over now? Though indeed, who knows? I might,
      perhaps, have been more grieved if I had got this news a fortnight
      sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortnight?&rdquo; repeated Lisa. &ldquo;But what has happened then in the last
      fortnight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky made no answer, and suddenly Lisa flushed even more than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you guess why,&rdquo; Lavretsky cried suddenly, &ldquo;in the course of
      this fortnight I have come to know the value of a pure woman&rsquo;s heart, and
      my past seems further from me than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa was confused, and went gently into the flower-garden towards
      Lenotchka and Shurotchka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am glad I showed you that newspaper,&rdquo; said Lavretsky, walking after
      her; &ldquo;already I have grown used to hiding nothing from you, and I hope you
      will repay me with the same confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect it?&rdquo; said Lisa, standing still. &ldquo;In that case I ought&mdash;but
      no! It is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Tell me, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I believe I ought not&mdash;after all, though,&rdquo; added Lisa,
      turning to Lavretsky with a smile, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the good of half confidence? Do
      you know I received a letter today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Panshin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. How did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asks for your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lisa, looking Lavretsky straight in the face with a serious
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky on his side looked seriously at Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what answer have you given him?&rdquo; he managed to say at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what answer to give,&rdquo; replied Lisa, letting her clasped
      hands fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that? Do you love him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like him; he seems a nice man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said the very same thing, and in the very same words, three days ago.
      I want to know do you love him with that intense passionate feeling which
      we usually call love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you understand it&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in love with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But is that necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma likes him,&rdquo; continued Lisa, &ldquo;he is kind; I have nothing against
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hesitate, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and perhaps&mdash;you, your words are the cause of it. Do you
      remember what you said three days ago? But that is weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my child!&rdquo; cried Lavretsky suddenly, and his voice was shaking, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      cheat yourself with sophistries, don&rsquo;t call weakness the cry of your
      heart, which is not ready to give itself without love. Do not take on
      yourself such a fearful responsibility to this man, whom you don&rsquo;t love,
      though you are ready to belong to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m obeying, I take nothing on myself,&rdquo; Lisa was murmuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey your heart; only that will tell you the truth,&rdquo; Lavretsky
      interrupted her. &ldquo;Experience, prudence, all that is dust and ashes! Do not
      deprive yourself of the best, of the sole happiness on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say that, Fedor Ivanitch? You yourself married for love, and were
      you happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky threw up his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t talk about me! You can&rsquo;t even understand all that a young,
      inexperienced, badly brought-up boy may mistake for love! Indeed though,
      after all, why should I be unfair to myself? I told you just now that I
      had not had happiness. No! I was not happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, Fedor Ivanitch,&rdquo; Lisa murmured in a low voice&mdash;when
      she did not agree with the person whom she was talking, she always dropped
      her voice; and now too she was deeply moved&mdash;&ldquo;happiness on earth does
      not depend on ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On ourselves, ourselves, believe me&rdquo; (he seized both her hands; Lisa grew
      pale and almost with terror but still steadfastly looked at him): &ldquo;if only
      we do not ruin our lives. For some people marriage for love may be
      unhappiness; but not for you, with your calm temperament, and your clear
      soul; I beseech you, do not marry without love, from a sense of duty,
      self-sacrifice, or anything.... That is infidelity, that is mercenary, and
      worse still. Believe me,&mdash;I have the right to say so; I have paid
      dearly for the right. And if your God&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Lavretsky noticed that Lenotchka and Shurotchka were
      standing near Lisa, and staring in dumb amazement at him. He dropped
      Lisa&rsquo;s hands, saying hurriedly, &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; and turned away
      towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing only I beg of you,&rdquo; he added, returning again to Lisa; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      decide at once, wait a little, think of what I have said to you. Even if
      you don&rsquo;t believe me, even if you did decide on a marriage of prudence&mdash;even
      in that case you mustn&rsquo;t marry Panshin. He can&rsquo;t be your husband. You will
      promise me not to be in a hurry, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa tried to answer Lavretsky, but she did not utter a word&mdash;not
      because she was resolved to &ldquo;be in a hurry,&rdquo; but because her heart was
      beating too violently and a feeling, akin to terror, stopped her breath.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      As he was coming away from the Kalitins, Lavretsky met Panshin; they bowed
      coldly to one another. Lavretsky went to his lodgings, and locked himself
      in. He was experiencing emotions such as he had hardly ever experienced
      before. How long ago was it since he had thought himself in a state of
      peaceful petrifaction? How long was it since he had felt as he had
      expressed himself at the very bottom of the river? What had changed his
      position? What had brought him out of his solitude? The most ordinary,
      inevitable, though always unexpected event, death? Yes; but he was not
      thinking so much of his wife&rsquo;s death and his own freedom, as of this
      question&mdash;what answer would Lisa give Panshin? He felt that in the
      course of the last three days, he had come to look at her with different
      eyes; he remembered how after returning home when he thought of her in the
      silence of the night, he had said to himself, &ldquo;if only!&rdquo;... That &ldquo;if only&rdquo;&mdash;in
      which he had referred to the past, to the impossible had come to pass,
      though not as he had imagined it,&mdash;but his freedom alone was little.
      &ldquo;She will obey her mother,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;she will marry Panshin; but even
      if she refuses him, won&rsquo;t it be just the same as far as I am concerned?&rdquo;
       Going up to the looking-glass he minutely scrutinised his own face and
      shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed quickly by in these meditations; and evening came.
      Lavretsky went to the Kalitins&rsquo;. He walked quickly, but his pace slackened
      as he drew near the house. Before the steps was standing Panshin&rsquo;s light
      carriage. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; though Lavretsky, &ldquo;I will not be an egoist&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      went into the house. He met with no one within-doors, and there was no
      sound in the drawing-room; he opened the door and saw Marya Dmitrievna
      playing picquet with Panshin. Panshin bowed to him without speaking, but
      the lady of the house cried, &ldquo;Well, this is unexpected!&rdquo; and slightly
      frowned. Lavretsky sat down near her, and began to look at her cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how to play picquet?&rdquo; she asked him with a kind of hidden
      vexation, and then declared that she had thrown away a wrong card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panshin counted ninety, and began calmly and urbanely taking tricks with a
      severe and dignified expression of face. So it befits diplomatists to
      play; this was no doubt how he played in Petersburg with some influential
      dignitary, whom he wished to impress with a favourable opinion of his
      solidity and maturity. &ldquo;A hundred and one, a hundred and two, hearts, a
      hundred and three,&rdquo; sounded his voice in measured tones, and Lavretsky
      could not decide whether it had a ring of reproach or of
      self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see Marfa Timofyevna?&rdquo; he inquired, observing that Panshin was
      setting to work to shuffle the cards with still more dignity. There was
      not a trace of the artist to be detected in him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you can. She is at home, up-stairs,&rdquo; replied Marya Dmitrievna;
      &ldquo;inquire for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky went up-stairs. He found Marfa Timofyevna also at cards; she was
      playing old maid with Nastasya Karpovna. Roska barked at him; but both the
      old ladies welcomed him cordially. Marfa Timofyevna especially seemed in
      excellent spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Fedya!&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;pray sit down, my dear. We are just finishing our
      game. Would you like some preserve? Shurotchka, bring him a pot of
      strawberry. You don&rsquo;t want any? Well, sit there; only you mustn&rsquo;t smoke; I
      can&rsquo;t bear your tobacco, and it makes Matross sneeze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky made haste to assure her that he had not the least desire to
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been down-stairs?&rdquo; the old lady continued. &ldquo;Whom did you see
      there? Is Panshin still on view? Did you see Lisa? No? She was meaning to
      come up here. And here she is: speak of angels&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa came into the room, and she flushed when she saw Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in for a minute, Marfa Timofyevna,&rdquo; she was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why for a minute?&rdquo; interposed the old lady. &ldquo;Why are you always in such a
      hurry, you young people? You see I have a visitor; talk to him a little,
      and entertain him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa sat down on the edge of a chair; she raised her eyes to Lavretsky&mdash;and
      felt that it was impossible not to let him know how her interview with
      Panshin had ended. But how was she to do it? She felt both awkward and
      ashamed. She had not long known him, this man who rarely went to church,
      and took his wife&rsquo;s death so calmly&mdash;and here was she, confiding al
      her secrets to him.... It was true he took an interest in her; she herself
      trusted him and felt drawn to him; but all the same, she was ashamed, as
      though a stranger had been into her pure, maiden bower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna came to her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t entertain him,&rdquo; said Marfa Timofyevna, &ldquo;who will, poor
      fellow? I am too old for him, he is too clever for me, and for Nastasya
      Karpovna he&rsquo;s too old, it&rsquo;s only the quite young men she will look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I entertain Fedor Ivanitch?&rdquo; said Lisa. &ldquo;If he likes, had I not
      better play him something on the piano?&rdquo; she added irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital; you&rsquo;re my clever girl,&rdquo; rejoined Marfa Timofyevna. &ldquo;Step
      down-stairs, my dears; when you have finished, come back: I have been made
      old maid, I don&rsquo;t like it, I want to have my revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa got up. Lavretsky went after her. As she went down the staircase,
      Lisa stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say truly,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that people&rsquo;s hearts are full of
      contradictions. Your example ought to frighten me, to make me distrust
      marriage for love; but I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have refused him?&rdquo; interrupted Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I have not consented either. I told him everything, everything I
      felt, and asked him to wait a little. Are you pleased with me?&rdquo; she added
      with a swift smile&mdash;and with a light touch of her hand on the
      banister she ran down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I play to you?&rdquo; she asked, opening the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you like,&rdquo; answered Lavretsky as he sat down so that he could look
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa began to play, and for a long while she did not lift her eyes from
      her fingers. She glanced at last at Lavretsky, and stopped short; his face
      seemed strange and beautiful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy; I&rsquo;m glad of you, I&rsquo;m glad to see
      you&mdash;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Lisa a few moments later, &ldquo;that if he had really
      loved me, he would not have written that letter; he must have felt that I
      could not give him an answer now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is of no consequence,&rdquo; observed Lavretsky, &ldquo;what is important is
      that you don&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, how can we talk like this? I keep thinking of you dead wife, and
      you frighten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Voldemar, that Liseta plays charmingly?&rdquo; Marya
      Dmitrievna was saying at that moment to Panshin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Panshin, &ldquo;very charmingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna looked tenderly at her young partner, but the latter
      assumed a still more important and care-worn air and called fourteen
      kings.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lavretsky was not a young man; he could not long delude himself as to the
      nature of the feeling inspired in him by Lisa; he was brought on that day
      to the final conviction that he loved her. This conviction did not give
      him ay great pleasure. &ldquo;Have I really nothing better to do,&rdquo; he thought,
      &ldquo;at thirty-five than to put my soul into a woman&rsquo;s keeping again? But Lisa
      is not like her; she would not demand degrading sacrifices from me: she
      would not tempt me away from my duties; she would herself incite me to
      hard honest work, and we would walk hand in hand towards a noble aim.
      Yes,&rdquo; he concluded his reflections, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all very fine, but the worst
      of it is that she does not in the least wish to walk hand in hand with me.
      She meant it when she said that I frightened her. But she doesn&rsquo;t love
      Panshin either&mdash;a poor consolation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky went back to Vassilyevskoe, but he could not get through four
      days there&mdash;so dull it seemed to him. He was also in agonies of
      suspense; the news announced by M. Jules required confirmation, and he had
      received no letters of any kind. He returned to the town and spent an
      evening at the Kalitins&rsquo;. He could easily see that Marya Dmitrievna had to
      been set against him; but he succeeded in softening her a little, by
      losing fifteen roubles to her at picquet, and he spent nearly half an hour
      almost alone with Lisa in spite of the fact that her mother had advised
      her the previous evening not to be too intimate with a man qui a un si
      grand ridicule. He found a change in her; she had become, as it were, more
      thoughtful. She reproached him for his absence and asked him would he not
      go on the morrow to mass? (The next day was Sunday.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go,&rdquo; she said before he had time to answer, &ldquo;we will pray together fro
      the repose of her soul.&rdquo; Then she added that she did not know how to act&mdash;she
      did not know whether she had the right to make Panshin wait any longer for
      her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; inquired Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I begin now to suspect what that decision will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She declared that her head ached and went to her own room up-stairs,
      hesitatingly holding out the tips of her fingers to Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Lavretsky went to mass. Lisa was already in the church when
      he came in. She noticed him though she did not turn round towards him. She
      prayed fervently, her eyes were full of a calm light, calmly she bowed her
      head and lifted it again. He felt that she was praying for him too, and
      his heart was filled with a marvelous tenderness. He was happy and a
      little ashamed. The people reverently standing, the homely faces, the
      harmonious singing, the scent of incense, the long slanting gleams of
      light from the windows, the very darkness of the walls and arched roofs,
      all went to his heart. For long he had not been to church for long he had
      not turned to God: even now he uttered no words of prayer&mdash;he did not
      even pray without words&mdash;but, at least, for a moment in all his mind,
      if not in his body, he bowed down and meekly humbled himself to earth. He
      remembered how, in his childhood, he had always prayed in church until he
      had felt, as it were, a cool touch on his! brow; that, he used to think
      then, is the guardian angel receiving me, laying on me the seal of grace.
      He glanced at Lisa. &ldquo;You brought me here,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;touch me, touch my
      soul.&rdquo; She was still praying calmly; her face seemed him to him full of
      joy, and he was softened anew: he prayed for another soul, peace; for his
      own, forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met in the porch; she greeted him with glad and gracious seriousness.
      The sun brightly lighted up the young grass in the church-yard, and the
      striped dresses and kerchiefs of the women; the bells of the churches near
      were tinkling overhead; and the crows were cawing about the hedges.
      Lavretsky stood with uncovered head, a smile on his lips; the light breeze
      lifted his hair, and the ribbons of Lisa&rsquo;s hat. He put Lisa and Lenotchka
      who was with her into their carriage, divided all his money among the
      poor, and peacefully sauntered home.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Painful days followed for Fedor Ivanitch. He found himself in a continual
      fever. Every morning he made for the post, and tore open letters and
      papers in agitation, and nowhere did he find anything which could confirm
      or disprove the fateful rumour. Sometimes he was disgusting to himself.
      &ldquo;What am I about,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;waiting, like a vulture for blood, for
      certain news of my wife&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; He went to the Kalitins every day, but
      things had grown no easier for him there; the lady of the house was
      obviously sulky with him, and received him very condescendingly. Panshin
      treated him with exaggerated politeness; Lemm had entrenched himself in
      his misanthropy and hardly bowed to him, and, worst of all, Lisa seemed to
      avoid him. When she happened to be left alone with him, instead of her
      former candour there was visible embarrassment on her part, she did not
      know what to say to him, and he, too, felt confused. In the space of a few
      days Lisa had become quite different from what she was as he knew her: in
      her movements, her voice, her very laugh a secret tremor, an unevenness
      never there before was apparent. Marya Dmitrievna, like a true egoist,
      suspected nothing; but Marfa Timofyevna began to keep a watch over her
      favourite. Lavretsky more than once reproached himself for having shown
      Lisa the newspaper he had received; he could not but be conscious that in
      his spiritual condition there was something revolting to a pure nature. He
      imagined also that the change in Lisa was the result of her inward
      conflicts, her doubts as to what answer to give Panshin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she brought him a book, a novel of Walter Scott&rsquo;s, which she had
      herself asked him for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t bring myself to read just now,&rdquo; she answered, and was about
      to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute, it is so long since I have been alone with you. You seem
      to be afraid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t yet decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she said, not raising her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa flushed crimson all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me about anything!&rdquo; she broke out hotly. &ldquo;I know nothing; I
      don&rsquo;t know myself.&rdquo; And instantly she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day Lavretsky arrived at the Kalitins&rsquo; after dinner and
      found there all the preparations for an evening service. In the corner of
      the dining-room on a square table covered with a clean cloth were already
      arranged, leaning up against the wall, the small holy pictures in old
      frames, set with tarnished jewels. The old servant in a grey coat and
      shoes was moving noiselessly and without haste all about the room; he set
      two wax-candles in the slim candlesticks before the holy pictures, crossed
      himself, bowed, and slowly went out. The unlighted drawing-room was empty.
      Lavretsky went into the dining-room and asked if it was some one&rsquo;s
      name-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a whisper the told him no, but that the evening service had been
      arranged at the desire of Lisaveta Mihalovna and Marfa Timofyevna; that it
      had been intended to invite a wonder-working image, but that the latter
      had gone thirty versts away to visit a sick man. Soon the priest arrived
      with the deacons; he was a man no longer young, with a large bald head; he
      coughed loudly in the hall: the ladies at once filed slowly out of the
      boudoir, and went up to receive his blessing; Lavretsky bowed to them in
      silence; and in silence to him. The priest stood still for a little while,
      coughed once again, and asked in a bass undertone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish me to begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray begin father,&rdquo; replied Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to put on his robes; a deacon in a surplice asked obsequiously
      for a hot ember; there was a scent of incense. The maids and men-servants
      came out from the hall and remained huddled close together before the
      door. Roska, who never came down from up-stairs, suddenly ran into the
      dining-room; they began to chase her out; she was scared, doubled back
      into the room and sat down; a footman picked her up and carried her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening service began. Lavretsky squeezed himself into a corner; his
      emotions were strange, almost sad; he could not himself make out clearly
      what he was feeling. Marya Dmitrievna stood in front of all, before the
      chairs; she crossed herself with languid carelessness, like a grand lady,
      and first looked about her, then suddenly lifted her eyes to the ceiling;
      she was bored. Marfa Timofyevna looked worried; Nastasya Karpovna bowed
      down to the ground and got up with a kind of discreet, subdued rustle;
      Lisa remained standing in her place motionless; from the concentrated
      expression of her face it could be seen that she was praying steadfastly
      and fervently. When she bowed to the cross at the end of the service, she
      also kissed the large red hand of the priest. Marya Dmitrievna invited the
      latter to have some tea; he took off his vestment, assumed a somewhat more
      worldly air, and passed into the drawing-room with the ladies.
      Conversation&mdash;not too lively&mdash;began. The priest drank four cups
      of tea, incessantly wiping his bald head with his handkerchief; he related
      among other things that the merchant Avoshnikov was subscribing seven
      hundred roubles to gilding the &ldquo;cumpola&rdquo; of the church, and informed them
      of a sure remedy against freckles. Lavretsky tried to sit near Lisa, but
      her manner was severe, almost stern, and she did not once glance at him.
      She appeared intentionally not to observe him; a kind of cold, grave
      enthusiasm seemed to have taken possession of her. Lavretsky for some
      reason or other tried to smile and to say something amusing; but there was
      perplexity in his heart, and he went away at last in secret bewilderment
      .... He felt there was something in Lisa to which he could never
      penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time Lavretsky was sitting in the drawing-room listening to the
      sly but tedious gossip of Gedeonovsky, when suddenly, without himself
      knowing why, he turned round and caught a profound, attentive questioning
      look in Lisa&rsquo;s eyes.... It was bent on him, this enigmatic look. Lavretsky
      thought of it the whole night long. His love was not like a boy&rsquo;s; sighs
      and agonies were not in his line, and Lisa herself did not inspire a
      passion of that kind; but for every age love has its tortures&mdash;and he
      was spared none of them.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day Lavretsky, according to his habit, was at the Kalitins&rsquo;. After an
      exhaustingly hot day, such a lovely evening had set in that Marya
      Dmitrievna, in spite of her aversion to a draught, ordered all the windows
      and doors into the garden to be thrown open, and declared that she would
      not play cards, that it was a sin to play cards in such weather, and one
      ought to enjoy nature. Panshin was the only guest. He was stimulated by
      the beauty of the evening, and conscious of a flood of artistic
      sensations, but he did not care to sing before Lavretsky, so he fell to
      reading poetry; he read aloud well, but too self-consciously and with
      unnecessary refinements, a few poems of Lermontov (Pushkin had not then
      come into fashion again). Then suddenly, as though ashamed of his
      enthusiasm, began, a propos of the well-known poem, &ldquo;A Reverie,&rdquo; to attack
      and fall foul of the younger generation. While doing so he did not lose
      the opportunity of expounding how he would change everything! after his
      own fashion, if the power were in his hands. &ldquo;Russia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has
      fallen behind Europe; we must catch her up. It is maintained that we are
      young&mdash;that&rsquo;s nonsense. Moreover we have no inventiveness: Homakov
      himself admits that we have not even invented mouse-traps. Consequently,
      whether we will or no, we must borrow from others. We are sick, Lermontov
      says&mdash;I agree with him. But we are sick from having only half become
      Europeans, we must take a hair of the dog that bit us (&ldquo;le cadastre,&rdquo;
       thought Lavretsky). &ldquo;The best head, les meilleures tetes,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;among us have long been convinced of it. All peoples are essentially
      alike; only introduce among them good institutions, and the thing is done.
      Of course there may be adaptation to the existing national life; that is
      our affair&mdash;the affair of the official (he almost said &ldquo;governing&rdquo;)
      class. But in case of need don&rsquo;t be uneasy. The institutions will
      transform the life itself.&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna most feelingly assented to
      all Panshin said. &ldquo;What a clever man,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;is talking in my
      drawing-room!&rdquo; Lisa sat in silence leaning back against the window;
      Lavretsky too was silent. Marfa Timofyevna, playing cards with her old
      friend in the corner, muttered something to herself. Panshin walked up and
      down the room, and spoke eloquently, but with secret exasperation. It
      seemed as if he were abusing not a whole generation but a few people known
      to him. In a great lilac bush in the Kalitins&rsquo; garden a nightingale had
      built its nest; its first evening notes filled the pauses of the eloquent
      speech; the first stars were beginning to shine in the rosy sky over the
      motionless tops of the limes. Lavretsky got up and began to answer
      Panshin; an argument sprang up. Lavretsky championed the youth and the
      independence of Russia; he was ready to throw over himself and his
      generation, but he stood up for the new men, their convictions and
      desires. Panshin answered sharply and irritably. He maintained that the
      intelligent people ought to change everything, and was at last even
      brought to the point of forgetting his position as a kammer-yunker, and
      his career as an official, and calling Lavretsky an antiquated
      conservative, even hinting&mdash;very remotely it is true&mdash;at his
      dubious position in society. Lavretsky did not lose his temper. He did not
      raise his voice (he recollected that Mihalevitch too had called him
      antiquated but an antiquated Voltairean), and calmly proceeded to refute
      Panshin at all points. He proved to him the impracticability of sudden
      leaps and reforms from above, founded neither on knowledge of the
      mother-country, nor on any genuine faith in any ideal, even a negative
      one. He brought forward his own education as an example, and demanded
      before all things a recognition of the true spirit of the people and
      submission to it, without which even a courageous combat against error is
      impossible. Finally he admitted the reproach&mdash;well-deserved as he
      thought&mdash;of reckless waste of time and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very fine!&rdquo; cried Panshin at last, getting angry. &ldquo;You now
      have just returned to Russia, what do you intend to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cultivate the soil,&rdquo; answered Lavretsky, &ldquo;and try to cultivate it as well
      as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very praiseworthy, no doubt,&rdquo; rejoined Panshin, &ldquo;and I have been
      told that you have already had great success in that line; but you must
      allow that not every one is fit for pursuits of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Une nature poetique,&rdquo; observed Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;cannot, to be sure,
      cultivate... et puis, it is your vocation, Vladimir Nikolaich, to do
      everything en grand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much even for Panshin: he grew confused and changed the
      conversation. He tried to turn it upon the beauty of the starlit sky, the
      music of Schubert; nothing was successful. He ended by proposing to Marya
      Dmitrievna a game of picquet. &ldquo;What! on such an evening?&rdquo; she replied
      feebly. She ordered the cards to be brought in, however. Panshin tore open
      a new pack of cards with a loud crash, and Lisa and Lavretsky both got up
      as if by agreement, and went and placed themselves near Marfa Timofyevna.
      They both felt all at once so happy that they were even a little afraid of
      remaining alone together, and at the same time they both felt that the
      embarrassment they had been conscious of for the last few days had
      vanished, and would return no more. The old lady stealthily patted
      Lavretsky on the cheek, slyly screwed up her eyes, and shook her head once
      or twice, adding in a whisper, &ldquo;You have shut up our clever friend, many
      thanks.&rdquo; Everything was hushed in the room; the only sound was the faint
      crackling of the wax-candles, and sometimes the tap of a hand on the
      table, and an exclamation or reckoning of points; and the rich torrent of
      the nightingale&rsquo;s song, powerful piercingly sweet, poured in at the
      window, together with the dewy freshness of the night.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lisa had not uttered a word in the course of the dispute between Lavretsky
      and Panshin, but she had followed it attentively and was completely on
      Lavretsky&rsquo;s side. Politics interested her very little; but the
      supercilious tone of the worldly official (he had never delivered himself
      in that way before) repelled her; his contempt for Russia wounded her. It
      had never occurred to Lisa that she was a patriot; but her heart was with
      the Russian people; the Russian turn of mind delighted her; she would talk
      for hours together without ceremony to the peasant-overseer of her
      mother&rsquo;s property when he came to the town, and she talked to him as to an
      equal, without any of the condescension of a superior. Lavretsky felt all
      this; he would not have troubled himself to answer Panshin by himself; he
      had spoken only for Lisa&rsquo;s sake. They had said nothing to one another,
      their eyes even had seldom met. But they both knew that they had grown
      closer that evening, they knew that they liked! and disliked the same
      things. On one point only were they divided; but Lisa secretly hoped to
      bring him to God. They sat near Marfa Timofyevna, and appeared to be
      following her play; indeed, they were really following it, but meanwhile
      their hearts were full, and nothing was lost on them; for them the
      nightingale sang, and the stars shone, and the trees gently murmured,
      lulled to sleep by the summer warmth and softness. Lavretsky was
      completely carried away, and surrendered himself wholly to his passion&mdash;and
      rejoiced in it. But no word can express what was passing in the pure heart
      of the young girl. It was a mystery for herself. Let it remain a mystery
      for all. No one knows, no one has seen, nor will ever see, how the grain,
      destined to life and growth, swells and ripens in the bosom of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o&rsquo;clock struck. Marfa Timofyevna went off up-stairs to her own
      apartments with Nastasya Karpovna. Lavretsky and Lisa walked across the
      room, stopped at the open door into the garden, looked into the darkness
      in the distance and then at one another, and smiled. They could have taken
      each other&rsquo;s hands, it seemed, and talked to their hearts&rsquo; content. They
      returned to Marya Dmitrievna and Panshin, where a game of picquet was
      still dragging on. The last king was called at last, and the lady of the
      house rose, sighing and groaning from her well-cushioned easy chair.
      Panshin took his hat, kissed Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s hand, remarking that
      nothing hindered some happy people now from sleeping, but that he had to
      sit up over stupid papers till morning, and departed, bowing coldly to
      Lisa (he had not expected that she would ask him to wait so long for an
      answer to his offer, and he was cross with her for it). Lavretsky followed
      him. They parted at the gate. Panshin walked his! coachman by poking him
      in the neck with the end of his stick, took his seat in the carriage and
      rolled away. Lavretsky did not want to go home. He walked away from the
      town into the open country. The night was still and clear, though there
      was no moon. Lavretsky rambled a long time over the dewy grass. He came
      across a little narrow path; and went along it. It led him up to a long
      fence, and to a little gate; he tried, not knowing why, to push it open.
      With a faint creak the gate opened, as though it had been waiting the
      touch of his hand. Lavretsky went into the garden. After a few paces along
      a walk of lime-trees he stopped short in amazement; he recognised the
      Kalitins&rsquo; garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved at once into a black patch of shade thrown by a thick clump of
      hazels, and stood a long while without moving, shrugging his shoulders in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This cannot be for nothing,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was hushed around. From the direction of the house not a sound reached
      him. He went cautiously forward. At the bend of an avenue suddenly the
      whole house confronted him with its dark face; in two upstair-windows only
      a light was shining. In Lisa&rsquo;s room behind the white curtain a candle was
      burning, and in Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s bedroom a lamp shone with red-fire
      before the holy picture, and was reflected with equal brilliance on the
      gold frame. Below, the door on to the balcony gaped wide open. Lavretsky
      sat down on a wooden garden-seat, leaned on his elbow, and began to watch
      this door and Lisa&rsquo;s window. In the town it struck midnight; a little
      clock in the house shrilly clanged out twelve; the watchman beat it with
      jerky strokes upon his board. Lavretsky had no thought, no expectation; it
      was sweet to him to feel himself near Lisa, to sit in her garden on the
      seat where she herself had sat more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light in Lisa&rsquo;s room vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep well, my sweet girl,&rdquo; whispered Lavretsky, still sitting
      motionless, his eyes fixed on the darkened window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the light appeared in one of the windows of the ground-floor,
      then changed into another, and a third.... Some one was walking through
      the rooms with a candle. &ldquo;Can it be Lisa? It cannot be.&rdquo; Lavretsky got
      up.... He caught a glimpse of a well-known face&mdash;Lisa came into the
      drawing-room. In a white gown, her plaits hanging loose on her shoulders,
      she went quietly up to the table, bent over it, put down the candle, and
      began looking for something. Then turning round facing the garden, she
      drew near the open door, and stood on the threshold, a light slender
      figure all in white. A shiver passed over Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa!&rdquo; broke hardly audibly from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and began to gaze into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa!&rdquo; Lavretsky repeated louder, and he came out of the shadow of the
      avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa raised her head in alarm, and shrank back. She had recognised him. He
      called to her a third time, and stretched out his hands to her. She came
      away from the door and stepped into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;listen to me,&rdquo; whispered Lavretsky, and seizing her hand
      he led her to the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him without resistance, her pale face, her fixed eyes, and
      all her gestures expressed an unutterable bewilderment. Lavretsky made her
      sit down and stood before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean to come here,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Something brought me.... I&mdash;I
      love you,&rdquo; he uttered in involuntary terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa slowly looked at him. It seemed as though she only at that instant
      knew where she was and what was happening. She tried to get up, she could
      no, and she covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa,&rdquo; murmured Lavretsky. &ldquo;Lisa,&rdquo; he repeated, and fell at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her shoulders began to heave slightly; the fingers of her pale hands were
      pressed more closely to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Lavretsky urged, and he heard a subdued sob. His heart stood
      still.... He knew the meaning of those tears. &ldquo;Can it be that you love
      me?&rdquo; he whispered, and caressed her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he heard her voice, &ldquo;get up, Fedor Ivanitch. What are we doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and sat beside her on the seat. She was not weeping now, and she
      looked at him steadfastly with her wet eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It frightens me: what are we doing?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I am ready to devote my whole life to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered again, as though something had stung her, and lifted her
      eyes towards heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is in God&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you love me, Lisa? We shall be happy.&rdquo; She dropped her eyes; he
      softly drew her to him, and her head sank on to his shoulder.... He bent
      his head a little and touched her pale lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Lavretsky was standing before the little garden gate.
      He found it locked and was obliged to get over the fence. He returned to
      the town and walked along the slumbering streets. A sense of immense,
      unhoped-for happiness filled his soul; all his doubts had died away.
      &ldquo;Away, dark phantom of the past,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She loves me, she will be
      mine.&rdquo; Suddenly it seemed to him that in the air over his head were
      floating strains of divine triumphant music. He stood still. The music
      resounded in still greater magnificence; a mighty flood of melody&mdash;and
      all his bliss seemed speaking and singing in its strains. He looked about
      him; the music floated down from two upper windows of a small house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemm?&rdquo; cried Lavretsky as he ran to the house. &ldquo;Lemm! Lemm!&rdquo; he repeated
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds died away and the figure of the old man in a dressing-gown,
      with his throat bare and his hair dishevelled, appeared at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he said with dignity, &ldquo;is it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher Fedoritch, what marvellous music! for mercy&rsquo;s sake, let me
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without uttering a word, the old man with a majestic flourish of the arm
      dropped the key of the street door from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky hastened up-stairs, went into the room and was about to rush up
      to Lemm; but the latter imperiously motioned him to a seat, saying
      abruptly in Russian, &ldquo;Sit down and listen,&rdquo; sat down himself to the piano,
      and looking proudly and severely about him, he began to play. It was long
      since Lavretsky had listened to anything like it. The sweet passionate
      melody went to his heart from the first note; it was glowing and
      languishing with inspiration, happiness and beauty; it swelled and melted
      away; it touched on all that is precious, mysterious, and holy on earth.
      It breathed of deathless sorrow and mounted dying away to the heavens.
      Lavretsky drew himself up, and rose cold and pale with ecstasy. This music
      seemed to clutch his very soul, so lately shaken by the rapture of love,
      the music was glowing with love too. &ldquo;Again!&rdquo; he whispered as the last
      chord sounded. The old man threw him an eagle glance, struck his hand on
      his chest and saying deliberately in his own tongue, &ldquo;This is my work, I
      am a great musician,&rdquo; he played again his marvellous composition. There
      was no candle in the room; the light of the rising moon fell aslant on the
      window; the soft air was vibrating with sound; the poor little room seemed
      a holy place, and the old man&rsquo;s head stood out noble and inspired in the
      silvery half light. Lavretsky went up to him and embraced him. At first
      Lemm did not respond to his embrace and even pushed him away with his
      elbow. For a long while without moving in any limb he kept the same
      severe, almost morose expression, and only growled out twice, &ldquo;aha.&rdquo; At
      last his face relaxed, changed, and grew calmer, and in response to
      Lavretsky&rsquo;s warm congratulations he smiled a little at first, then burst
      into tears, and sobbed weakly like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have come just at this moment; but I
      know all, I know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all?&rdquo; Lavretsky repeated in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard me,&rdquo; replied Lemm, &ldquo;did you not understand that I knew
      all?&rdquo;

      Till daybreak Lavretsky could not sleep, all night he was sitting on his
      bed. And Lisa too did not sleep; she was praying.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reader knows how Lavretsky grew up and developed. Let us say a few
      words about Lisa&rsquo;s education. She was in her tenth year when her father
      died; but he had not troubled himself much about her. Weighed down with
      business cares, for ever anxious for the increase of his property,
      bilious, sharp and impatient, he gave money unsparingly for the teachers,
      tutors, dress and other necessities of his children; but he could not
      endure, as he expressed it, &ldquo;to be dandling his squallers,&rdquo; and indeed had
      no time to dandle them. He worked, took no rest from business, slept
      little, rarely played cards, and worked again. He compared himself to a
      horse harnessed to a threshing-machine. &ldquo;My life has soon come to an end,&rdquo;
       was his comment on his deathbed, with a bitter smile on his parched lips.
      Marya Dmitrievna did not in reality trouble herself about Lisa any more
      than her husband, though she had boasted to Lavretsky that she alone had
      educated her children. She dressed her up like a doll, stroked her on the
      head before visitors and called her a clever child and a darling to her
      face, and that was all. Any kind of continuous care was too exhausting for
      the indolent lady. During her father&rsquo;s lifetime, Lisa was in the hands of
      a governess, Mademoiselle Moreau from Paris, after his death she passed
      into the charge of Marfa Timofyevna. Marfa Timofyevna the reader knows
      already; Mademoiselle Moreau was a tiny wrinkled creature with little
      bird-like ways and a bird&rsquo;s intellect. In her youth she had led a very
      dissipated life, but in old age she had only two passions left&mdash;gluttony
      and cards. When she had eaten her fill, and was neither playing cards nor
      chattering, her face assumed an expression almost death-like. She was
      sitting, looking, breathing&mdash;yet it was clear that there was not an
      idea in her head. One could not even call her good-natured. Birds are not
      good-natured. Either as a result of her frivolous youth or of the air of
      Paris, which she had breathed from childhood, a kind of cheap universal
      scepticism had found its way into her, usually expressed by the words:
      tout ca c&rsquo;est des betises. She spoke ungrammatically, but in a pure
      Parisian jargon, did not talk scandal and had no caprices&mdash;what more
      can one desire in a governess? Over Lisa she had little influence; all the
      stronger was the influence on her of her nurse, Agafya Vlasyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman&rsquo;s story was remarkable. She came of a peasant family. She was
      married at sixteen to a peasant; but she was strikingly different from her
      peasant sisters. Her father had been twenty years starosta, and had made a
      good deal of money, and he spoiled her. She was exceptionally beautiful,
      the best-dressed girl in the whole district, clever, ready with her
      tongue, and daring. Her master Dmitri Pestov, Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s father, a
      man of modest and gentle character, saw her one day at the
      threshing-floor, talked to her and fell passionately in love with her. She
      was soon left a widow; Pestov, though he was a married man, took her into
      his house and dressed her like a lady. Agafya at once adapted herself to
      her new position, just as if she had never lived differently all her life.
      She grew fairer and plumper; her arms grew as &ldquo;floury white&rdquo; under her
      muslin-sleeves as a merchant&rsquo;s lady&rsquo;s; the samovar never left her table;
      she would wear nothing except silk or velvet, and slept on well-stuffed
      feather-beds. This blissful existence lasted for five years, but Dmitri
      Pestov died; his widow, a kind-hearted woman, out of regard for the memory
      of the deceased, did not wish to treat her rival unfairly, all the more
      because Agafya had never forgotten herself in her presence. She married
      her, however, to a shepherd, and sent her a long way off. Three years
      passed. It happened one hot summer day that her mistress in driving past
      stopped at the cattle-yard. Agafya regaled her with such delicious cool
      cream, behaved so modestly, and was so neat, so bright, and so contented
      with everything that her mistress signified her forgiveness to her and
      allowed her to return to the house. Within six months she had become so
      much attached to her that she raised her to be housekeeper, and intrusted
      the whole household management to her. Agafya again returned to power, and
      again grew plump and fair; her mistress put the most complete confidence
      in her. So passed five years more. Misfortune again overtook Agafya. Her
      husband, whom she had promoted to be a footman, began to drink, took to
      vanishing from the house, and ended by stealing six of the mistress&rsquo; 
      silver spoons and hiding them till a favourable moment in his wife&rsquo;s box.
      It was opened. He was sent to be a shepherd again, and Agafya fell into
      disgrace. She was not turned out of the house, but was degraded from
      housekeeper to being a sewing-woman and was ordered to wear a kerchief on
      her head instead of a cap. To the astonishment of every one, Agafya
      accepted with humble resignation the blow that had fallen upon her. She
      was at that time about thirty, all her children were dead and her husband
      did not live much longer. The time had come for her to reflect. And she
      did reflect. She became very silent and devout, never missed a single
      matin&rsquo;s service nor a single mass, and gave away all her fine clothes. She
      spent fifteen years quietly, peacefully, and soberly, never quarrelling
      with any one and giving way to every one. If any! one scolded her, she
      only bowed to them and thanked them for the admonition. Her mistress had
      long ago forgiven her, raised her out of disgrace, and made her a present
      of a cap of her own. But she was herself unwilling to give up the kerchief
      and always wore a dark dress. After her mistress&rsquo; death she became still
      more quiet and humble. A Russian readily feels fear, and affection; but it
      is hard to gain his respect: it is not soon given, nor to every one. For
      Agafya every one in the home had great respect; no one even remembered her
      previous sins, as though they had been buried with the old master.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kalitin became Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s husband, he wanted to intrust the
      care of the house to Agafya. But she refused &ldquo;on account of temptation;&rdquo;
       he scolded her, but she bowed humbly and left the room. Kalitin was clever
      in understanding men; he understood Agafya and did not forget her. When he
      moved to the town, he gave her, with her consent, the place of nurse to
      Lisa, who was only just five years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa was at first frightened by the austere and serious face of her new
      nurse; but she soon grew used to her and began to love her. She was
      herself a serious child. Her features recalled Kalitin&rsquo;s decided and
      regular profile, only her eyes were not her father&rsquo;s; they were lighted up
      by a gentle attentiveness and goodness, rare in children. She did not care
      to play with dolls, never laughed loudly or for long, and behaved with
      great decorum. She was not often thoughtful, but when she was, it was
      almost always with some reason. After a short silence, she usually turned
      to some grown-up person with a question which showed that her brain had
      been at work upon some new impression. She very early got over childish
      lispings, and by the time she was four years old spoke perfectly plainly.
      She was afraid of her father; her feeling towards her mother was
      undefinable, she was not afraid of her, nor was she demonstrative to her;
      but she was not demonstrative even towards Agafya, though she was the only
      person she loved. Agafya never left her. It was curious to see them
      together. Agafya, all in black, with a dark handkerchief on her head, her
      face thin and transparent as wax, but still beautiful and expressive,
      would be sitting upright, knitting a stocking; Lisa would sit at her feet
      in a little arm-chair, also busied over some kind of work, and seriously
      raising her clear eyes, listening to what Agafya was relating to her. And
      Agafya did not tell her stories; but in even measured accents she would
      narrate the life of the Holy Virgin, the lives of hermits, saints, and
      holy men. She would tell Lisa how the holy men lived in deserts, how they
      were saved, how they suffered hunger and want, and did not fear kings, but
      confessed Christ; how fowls of the air brought them food and wild beasts
      listened to them, and flowers sprang up on the spots where their blood had
      been spilt. &ldquo;Wall-flowers?&rdquo; asked Lisa one ay, she was very fond of
      flowers.... Agafya spoke to Lisa gravely and meekly, as though she felt
      herself to be unworthy to utter such high and holy words. Lisa listened to
      her, and the image of the all-seeing, all-knowing God penetrated with a
      kind of sweet power into her very soul, filling it with pure and reverent
      awe; but Christ became for her something near, well-known, almost
      familiar. Agafya taught her to pray also. Sometimes she wakened Lisa early
      at daybreak, dressed her hurriedly, and took her in secret to matins. Lisa
      followed her on tiptoe, almost holding her breath. The cold and twilight
      of the early morning, the freshness and emptiness of the church, the very
      secrecy of these unexpected expeditions, the cautious return home and to
      her little bed, all these mingled impressions of the forbidden, strange,
      and holy agitated the little girl and penetrated to the very innermost
      depths of her nature. Agafya never censured any one, and never scolded
      Lisa for being naughty. When she was displeased at anything, she only kept
      silence. And Lisa understood this silence; with a child&rsquo;s
      quick-sightedness she knew very well, too, when Agafya was displeased with
      other people, Marya Dmitrievna, or Kalitin himself. For a little over
      three years, Agafya waited on Lisa, then Mademoiselle Moreau replaced her;
      but the frivolous Frenchwoman, with her cold ways and exclamation, tout ca
      c&rsquo;est des betises, could never dislodge her dear nurse from Lisa&rsquo;s heart;
      the seeds that had been dropped into it had become too deeply rooted.
      Besides, though Agafya no longer waited on Lisa, she was still in the
      house and often saw her charge, who believed in her as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agafya did not, however, get on well with Marfa Timofyevna, when she came
      to live in the Kalitins&rsquo; house. Such gravity and dignity on the part of
      one who had once worn the motley skirt of a peasant wench displeased the
      impatient and self-willed old lady. Agafya asked leave to go on a
      pilgrimage and she never came back. There were dark rumours that she had
      gone off to a retreat of sectaries. But the impression she had left in
      Lisa&rsquo;s soul was never obliterated. She went as before to the mass as to a
      festival, she prayed with rapture, with a kind of restrained and
      shamefaced transport, at which Marya Dmitrievna secretly marvelled not a
      little, and even Marfa Timofyevna, though she did not restrain Lisa in any
      way, tried to temper her zeal, and would not let her make too many
      prostrations to the earth in her prayers; it was not a lady-like habit,
      she would say. In her studies Lisa worked well, that is to say
      perseveringly; she was not gifted with specially brilliant abilities, or
      great intellect; she could not succeed in anything without labour. She
      played the piano well, but only Lemm knew what it had cost her. She had
      read little; she had not &ldquo;words of her own,&rdquo; but she had her own ideas,
      and she went her own way. It was not only on the surface that she took
      after her father; he, too, had never asked other people what was to be
      done. So she had grown up tranquilly and restfully till she had reached
      the age of nineteen. She was very charming, without being aware of it
      herself. Her every movement was full of spontaneous, somewhat awkward
      gracefulness; her voice had the silvery ring of untouched youth, the least
      feeling of pleasure called forth an enchanting smile on her lips, and
      added a deep light and a kind of mystic sweetness to her kindling eyes.
      Penetrated through and through by a sense of duty, by the dread of hurting
      any one whatever, with a kind and tender heart, she had loved all men, and
      no one in particular; God only she had! loved passionately, timidly, and
      tenderly. Lavretsky was the first to break in upon her peaceful inner
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Lisa.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the following day at twelve o&rsquo;clock, Lavretsky set off to the Kalitins.
      On the way he met Panshin, who galloped past him on horseback, his hat
      pulled down to his very eyebrows. At the Kalitins&rsquo;, Lavretsky was not
      admitted for the first time since he had been acquainted with them. Marya
      Dmitrievna was &ldquo;resting,&rdquo; so the footman informed him; her excellency had
      a headache. Marfa Timofyevna and Lisaveta Mihalovna were not at home.
      Lavretsky walked round the garden in the faint hope of meeting Lisa, but
      he saw no one. He came back two hours later and received the same answer,
      accompanied by a rather dubious look from the footman. Lavretsky thought
      it would be unseemly to call for a third time the same day, and he decided
      to drive over to Vassilyevskoe, where he had business moreover. On the
      road he made various plans for the future, each better than the last; but
      he was overtaken by a melancholy mood when he reached his aunt&rsquo;s little
      village. He fell into conversation! with Anton; the old man, as if
      purposely, seemed full of cheerless fancies. He told Lavretsky how, at her
      death, Glafira Petrovna had bitten her own arm, and after a brief pause,
      added with a sigh: &ldquo;Every man, dear master, is destined to devour
      himself.&rdquo; It was late when Lavretsky set off on the way back. He was
      haunted by the music of the day before, and Lisa&rsquo;s image returned to him
      in all its sweet distinctness; he mused with melting tenderness over the
      thought that she loved him, and reached his little house in the town,
      soothed and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that struck him as he went into the entrance hall was a
      scent of patchouli, always distasteful to him; there were some high
      travelling-trunks standing there. The face of his groom, who ran out to
      meet him, seemed strange to him. Not stopping to analyse his impressions,
      he crossed the threshold of the drawing room.... On his entrance there
      rose from the sofa a lady in a black silk dress with flounces, who,
      raising a cambric handkerchief to her pale face, made a few paces forward,
      bent her carefully dressed, perfumed head, and fell at his feet.... Then,
      only, he recognised her: this lady was his wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught his breath.... He leaned against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodore, do not repulse me!&rdquo; she said in French, and her voice cut to
      his heart like a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her senselessly, and yet he noticed involuntarily at once
      that she had grown both whiter and fatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodore!&rdquo; she went on, from time to time lifting her eyes and discreetly
      wringing her marvellously-beautiful fingers with their rosy, polished
      nails. &ldquo;Theodore, I have wronged you, deeply wronged you; I will say more,
      I have sinned: but hear me; I am tortured by remorse, I have grown hateful
      to myself, I could endure my position no longer; how many times have I
      thought of turning to you, but I feared your anger; I resolved to break
      every tie with the past.... Puis j&rsquo;ai ete si malade.... I have been so
      ill,&rdquo; she added, and passed her hand over her brow and cheek. &ldquo;I took
      advantage of the widely-spread rumour of my death, I gave up everything;
      without resting day or night I hastened hither; I hesitated long to appear
      before you, my judge... paraitre devant vous, mon juge; but I resolved at
      last, remembering your constant goodness, to come to you; I found your
      address at Moscow. Believe me,&rdquo; she went on, slowly getting up from the
      floor and sitting on the very! edge of an arm-chair, &ldquo;I have often thought
      of death, and I should have found courage enough to take my life... ah!
      life is a burden unbearable for me now!... but the thought of my daughter,
      my little Ada, stopped me. She is here, she is asleep in the next room,
      the poor child! She is tired&mdash;you shall see her; she at least has
      done you no wrong, and I am so unhappy, so unhappy!&rdquo; cried Madame
      Lavretsky, and she melted into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky came to himself at last; he moved away from the wall and turned
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going?&rdquo; cried his wife in a voice of despair. &ldquo;Oh, this is cruel!
      Without uttering one word to me, not even a reproach. This contempt will
      kill me, it is terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to hear from me?&rdquo; he articulated in an expressionless
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; she rejoined quickly, &ldquo;I know I have no right to
      expect anything; I am not mad, believe me; I do not hope, I do not dare to
      hope for your forgiveness; I only venture to entreat you to command me
      what I am to do, where I am to live. Like a slave I will fulfil your
      commands whatever they may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no commands to give you,&rdquo; replied Lavretsky in the same colourless
      voice; &ldquo;you know, all is over between us... and now more than ever; you
      can live where you like; and if your allowance is too little&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t say such dreadful things,&rdquo; Varvara Pavlovna interrupted him,
      &ldquo;spare me, if only... if only for the sake of this angel.&rdquo; And as she
      uttered these words, Varvara Pavlovna ran impulsively into the next room,
      and returned at once with a small and very elegantly dressed little girl
      in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thick flaxen curls fell over her pretty rosy little face, and on to her
      large sleepy black eyes; she smiled and blinked her eyes at the light and
      laid a chubby little hand on her mother&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ada, vois, c&rsquo;est ton pere,&rdquo; said Varvara Pavlovna, pushing the curls back
      from her eyes and kissing her vigorously, &ldquo;pre le avec moi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&rsquo;est ca, papa?&rdquo; stammered the little girl lisping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui, mon enfant, n&rsquo;est-ce pas que tu l&rsquo;aimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this was more than Lavretsky could stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a melodrama must there really be a scene like this?&rdquo; he muttered,
      and went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna stood still for some time in the same place, slightly
      shrugged her shoulders, carried the little girl off into the next room,
      undressed her and put her to bed. Then she took up a book and sat down
      near the lamp, and after staying up for an hour she went to bed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh bien, madame?&rdquo; queried her maid, a Frenchwoman whom she had brought
      from Paris, as she unlaced her corset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh bien, Justine,&rdquo; se replied, &ldquo;he is a good deal older, but I fancy he
      is just the same good-natured fellow. Give me my gloves for the night, and
      get out my grey high-necked dress for to-morrow, and don&rsquo;t forget the
      mutton cutlets for Ada.... I daresay it will be difficult to get them
      here; but we must try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A la guerre comme a la guerre,&rdquo; replied Justine as she put out the
      candle.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      For more than two hours Lavretsky wandered about the streets of town. The
      night he had spent in the outskirts of Paris returned to his mind. His
      heart was bursting and his head, dull and stunned, was filled again with
      the same dark senseless angry thoughts, constantly recurring. &ldquo;She is
      alive, she is here,&rdquo; he muttered with ever fresh amazement. He felt that
      he had lost Lisa. His wrath choked him; this blow had fallen too suddenly
      upon him. How could he so readily have believed in the nonsensical gossip
      of a journal, a wretched scrap of paper? &ldquo;Well, if I had not believed it,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;what difference would it have made? I should not have known
      that Lisa loved me; she would not have known it herself.&rdquo; He could not rid
      himself of the image, the voice, the eyes of his wife... and he cursed
      himself, he cursed everything in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied out he went towards morning to Lemm&rsquo;s. For a long while he could
      make no one hear; at last at a window the old man&rsquo;s head appeared in a
      nightcap, sour, wrinkled, and utterly unlike the inspired austere visage
      which twenty-four hours ago had looked down imperiously upon Lavretsky in
      all the dignity of artistic grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; queried Lemm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play to you every night, I have
      taken a decoction for a cold.&rdquo; But Lavretsky&rsquo;s face, apparently, struck
      him as strange; the old man made a shade for his eyes with his hand, took
      a look at his elated visitor, and let him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky went into the room and sank into a chair. The old man stood
      still before him, wrapping the skirts of his shabby striped dressing-gown
      around him, shrinking together and gnawing his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife is here,&rdquo; Lavretsky brought out. He raised his head and suddenly
      broke into involuntary laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemm&rsquo;s face expressed bewilderment, but he did not even smile, only
      wrapped himself closer in his dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Lavretsky went on, &ldquo;I had imagined... I read
      in a paper that she was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;oh, did you read that lately?&rdquo; asked Lemm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;oh,&rdquo; repeated the old man, raising his eyebrows. &ldquo;And she is
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She is at my house now; and I... I am an unlucky fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an unlucky fellow,&rdquo; Lemm repeated slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher Fedoritch,&rdquo; began Lavretsky, &ldquo;would you undertake to carry a
      note for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. May I know to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisavet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah... yes, yes, I understand. Very good. And when must the letter be
      received?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, as early as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. I can send Katrine, my cook. No, I will go myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will bring me an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will bring you an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemm sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my poor young friend; you are certainly an unlucky young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky wrote a few words to Lisa. He told her of his wife&rsquo;s arrival,
      begged her to appoint a meeting with him,&mdash;then he flung himself on
      the narrow sofa, with his face to the wall; and the old man lay down on
      the bed, and kept muttering a long while, coughing and drinking off his
      decoction by gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came; they both got up. With strange eyes they looked at one
      another. At that moment Lavretsky longed to kill himself. The cook,
      Katrine, brought them some villainous coffee. It struck eight. Lemm put on
      his hat, and saying that he was going to give a lesson at the Kalitins&rsquo; at
      ten, but he could find a suitable pretext for going there now, he set off.
      Lavretsky flung himself again on the little sofa, and once more the same
      bitter laugh stirred in the depth of his soul. He thought of how his wife
      had driven him out of his house; he imagined Lisa&rsquo;s position, covered his
      eyes and clasped his hands behind his head. At last Lemm came back and
      brought him a scrap of paper, on which Lisa had scribbled in pencil the
      following words: &ldquo;We cannot meet to-day; perhaps, to-morrow evening.
      Good-bye.&rdquo; Lavretsky thanked Lemm briefly and indifferently, and went
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his wife at breakfast; Ada, in curl-papers, in a little white
      frock with blue ribbons, was eating her mutton cutlet. Varvara Pavlovna
      rose at once directly Lavretsky entered the room, and went to meet him
      with humility in her face. He asked her to follow him into the study, shut
      the door after them, and began to walk up and down; she sat down, modestly
      laying one hand over the other, and began to follow his movements with her
      eyes, which were still beautiful, though they were pencilled lightly under
      their lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Lavretsky could not speak; he felt that he could not master
      himself, he saw clearly that Varvara Pavlovna was not in the least afraid
      of him, but was assuming an appearance of being ready to faint away in
      another instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, madam,&rdquo; he began at last, breathing with difficulty and at
      moments setting his teeth: &ldquo;it is useless for us to make pretense with one
      another; I don&rsquo;t believe in your penitence; and even if it were sincere,
      to be with you again, to live with you, would be impossible for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna bit her lips and half-closed her eyes. &ldquo;It is aversion,&rdquo;
       she thought; &ldquo;all is over; in his eyes I am not even a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; repeated Lavretsky, fastening the top buttons of his coat.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what induced you to come here; I suppose you have come to
      the end of your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you hurt me!&rdquo; whispered Varvara Pavlovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However that may be&mdash;you are, any way, my wife, unhappily. I cannot
      drive you away... and this is the proposal I make you. You may to-day, if
      you like, set off to Lavriky, and live there; there is, as you know, a
      good house there; you will have everything you need in addition to your
      allowance... Do you agree?&rdquo;&mdash;Varvara Pavlovna raised an embroidered
      handkerchief to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you already,&rdquo; she said, her lips twitching nervously, &ldquo;that I
      will consent to whatever you think fit to do with me; at present it only
      remains for me to beg of you&mdash;will you allow me at least to thank you
      for your magnanimity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thanks, I beg&mdash;it is better without that,&rdquo; Lavretsky said
      hurriedly. &ldquo;So then,&rdquo; he pursued, approaching the door, &ldquo;I may reckon on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow I will be at Lavriky,&rdquo; Varvara Pavlovna declared, rising
      respectfully from her place. &ldquo;But Fedor Ivanitch&mdash;&rdquo; (She no longer
      called him &ldquo;Theodore.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I have not yet gained any right to forgiveness; may I hope at
      least that with time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Varvara Pavlovna,&rdquo; Lavretsky broke in, &ldquo;you are a clever woman, but I
      too am not a fool; I know that you don&rsquo;t want forgiveness in the least.
      And I have forgiven you long ago; but there was always a great gulf
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how to submit,&rdquo; rejoined Varvara Pavlovna, bowing her head. &ldquo;I
      have not forgotten my sin; I should not have been surprised if I had
      learnt that you even rejoiced at the news of my death,&rdquo; she added softly,
      slightly pointing with her hand to the copy of the journal which was lying
      forgotten by Lavretsky on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fedor Ivanitch started; the paper had been marked in pencil. Varvara
      Pavlovna gazed at him with still greater humility. She was superb at that
      moment. Her grey Parisian gown clung gracefully round her supple, almost
      girlish figure; her slender, soft neck, encircled by a white collar, her
      bosom gently stirred by her even breathing, her hands innocent of
      bracelets and rings&mdash;her whole figure, from her shining hair to the
      tip of her just visible little shoe, was so artistic...
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky took her in with a glance of hatred; scarcely could he refrain
      from crying: &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; scarcely could he refrain from felling her with a
      blow of his fist on her shapely head&mdash;and he turned on his heel. An
      hour later he had started for Vassilyevskoe, and two hours later Varvara
      Pavlovna had bespoken the best carriage in the town, had put on a simple
      straw hat with a black veil, and a modest mantle, given Ada into the
      charge of Justine, and set off to the Kalitins&rsquo;. From the inquiries she
      had made among the servants, she had learnt that her husband went to see
      them every day.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day of the arrival of Lavretsky&rsquo;s wife at the town of O&mdash;&mdash;-,
      a sorrowful day for him, and been also a day of misery for Lisa. She had
      not had time to go down-stairs and say good-morning to her mother, when
      the tramp of hoofs was heard under the window, and with a secret dismay
      she saw Panshin riding into the courtyard. &ldquo;He has come so early for a
      final explanation,&rdquo; she thought, and she was not mistaken. After a turn in
      the drawing-room, he suggested that she should go with him into the
      garden, and then asked her for the decision of his fate. Lisa summoned up
      all her courage and told him that she could not be his wife. He heard her
      to the end, standing on one side of her and pulling his hat down over his
      forehead; courteously, but in a changed voice, he asked her, &ldquo;Was this her
      last word, and had he given her any ground for such a change in her
      views?&rdquo;&mdash;then pressed his hand to his eyes, sighed softly and
      abruptly, and took his head away from his face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not want to go along the beaten track,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;I wanted
      to choose a wife according to the dictates of my heart; but it seems this
      was not to be. Farewell, fond dream!&rdquo; He made Lisa a profound bow, and
      went back into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hoped that he would go away at once; but he went into Marya
      Dmitrievna&rsquo;s room and remained nearly an hour with her. As he came out, he
      said to Lisa: &ldquo;Votre mere vous appelle; adieu a jamais,&rdquo;... mounted his
      horse, and set off at full trot from the very steps. Lisa went in to Marya
      Dmitrievna and found her in tears; Panshin had informed her of his
      ill-luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to be the death of me? Do you want to be the death of me?&rdquo;
       was how the disconsolate widow began her lamentations. &ldquo;Whom do you want?
      Wasn&rsquo;t he good enough for you? A kammer-junker! not interesting! He might
      have married any Maid of Honour he liked in Petersburg. And I&mdash;I had
      so hoped for it! Is it long that you have changed towards him? How has
      this misfortune come on us,&mdash;it cannot have come of itself! Is it
      that dolt of a cousin&rsquo;s doing? A nice person you have picked up to advise
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he, poor darling,&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna went on, &ldquo;how respectful he is,
      how attentive even in his sorrow! He has promised not to desert me. Ah, I
      can never bear that! Ah, my head aches fit to split! Send me Palashka. You
      will be the death of me, if you don&rsquo;t think better of it,&mdash;do you
      hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, calling her twice an ungrateful girl, Marya Dmitrievna dismissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to her own room. But she had not had time to recover from her
      interviews with Panshin and her mother before another storm broke over
      head, and this time from a quarter from which she would least have
      expected it. Marfa Timofyevna came into her room, and at once slammed the
      door after her. The old lady&rsquo;s face was pale, her cap was awry, her eyes
      were flashing, and her hands and lips were trembling. Lisa was astonished;
      she had never before seen her sensible and reasonable aunt in such a
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty thing, miss,&rdquo; Marfa Timofyevna began in a shaking and broken
      whisper, &ldquo;a pretty thing! Who taught you such ways, I should like to know,
      miss?... Give me some water; I can&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, auntie, what is the matter?&rdquo; said Lisa, giving her a glass
      of water. &ldquo;Why, I thought you did not think much of Mr. Panshin yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna pushed away the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t drink; I shall knock my last teeth out if I try to. What&rsquo;s
      Panshin to do with it? Why bring Panshin in? You had better tell me who
      has taught you to make appointments at night&mdash;eh? miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, please, don&rsquo;t try to deny it,&rdquo; pursued Marfa Timofyevna; &ldquo;Shurotchka
      herself saw it all and told me. I have had to forbid her chattering, but
      she is not a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it, auntie,&rdquo; Lisa uttered scarcely audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! That&rsquo;s it, is it, miss; you made an appointment with him, that
      old sinner, who seems so meek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went down into the drawing-room for a book; he was in the garden&mdash;and
      he called me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you went? A pretty thing! So you love him, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him,&rdquo; answered Lisa softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful Heavens! She loves him!&rdquo; Marfa Timofyevna snatched off her cap.
      &ldquo;She loves a married man! Ah! she loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me&rdquo;...began Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he told you, the scoundrel, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that his wife was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna crossed herself. &ldquo;Peace be with her,&rdquo; she muttered; &ldquo;she
      was a vain hussy, God forgive her. So, then, he&rsquo;s a widower, I suppose.
      And he&rsquo;s losing no time, I see. He has buried one wife and now he&rsquo;s after
      another. He&rsquo;s a nice person: only let me tell you one thing, niece; in my
      day, when I was young, harm came to young girls from such goings on. Don&rsquo;t
      be angry with me, my girl, only fools are angry at the truth. I have given
      orders not to admit him to-day. I love him, but I shall never forgive him
      for this. Upon my word, a widower! Give me some water. But as for your
      sending Panshin about his business, I think you&rsquo;re a first-rate girl for
      that. Only don&rsquo;t you go sitting of nights with any animals of that sort;
      don&rsquo;t break my old heart, or else you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m not all fondness&mdash;I
      can bite too... a widower!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna went off, and Lisa sat down in a corner and began to cry.
      There was bitterness in her soul. She had not deserved such humiliation.
      Love had proved no happiness to her: she was weeping for a second time
      since yesterday evening. This new unexpected feeling had only just arisen
      in her heart, and already what a heavy price she had paid for it, how
      coarsely had strange hands touched her sacred secret. She felt ashamed,
      and bitter, and sick; but she had no doubt and no dread&mdash;and
      Lavretsky was dearer to her than ever. She had hesitated while she did not
      understand herself; but after that meeting, after that kiss&mdash;she
      could hesitate no more: she knew that she loved, and now she loved
      honestly and seriously, she was bound firmly for all her life, and she did
      not fear reproaches. She felt that by no violence could they break that
      bond.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna was much agitated when she received the announcement of
      the arrival of Varvara Pavlovna Lavretsky, she did not even know whether
      to receive her; she was afraid of giving offence to Fedor Ivanitch. At
      last curiosity prevailed. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;she too is a relation,&rdquo;
       and, taking up her position in an arm-chair, she said to the footman,
      &ldquo;Show her in.&rdquo; A few moments passed; the door opened, Varvara Pavlovna
      swiftly and with scarcely audible steps, approached Marya Dmitrievna, and
      not allowing her to rise from her chair, bent almost on her knees before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, dear aunt,&rdquo; she began in a soft voice full of emotion,
      speaking Russian; &ldquo;I thank you; I did not hope for such condescension on
      your part; you are an angel of goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered these words Varvara Pavlovna quite unexpectedly took
      possession of one of Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s hands, and pressing it lightly in
      her pale lavender gloves, she raised it in a fawning way to her full rosy
      lips. Marya Dmitrievna quite lost her head, seeing such a handsome and
      charmingly dressed woman almost at her feet. She did not know where she
      was. And she tried to withdraw her hand, while, at the same time, she was
      inclined to make her sit down, and to say something affectionate to her.
      She ended by raising Varvara Pavlovna and kissing her on her smooth
      perfumed brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna was completely overcome by this kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, bonjour,&rdquo; said Marya Dmitrievna. &ldquo;Of course I did not
      expect... but, of course, I am glad to see you. You understand, my dear,
      it&rsquo;s not for me to judge between man and wife&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband is in the right in everything,&rdquo; Varvara Pavlovna interposed;
      &ldquo;I alone am to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very praiseworthy feeling&rdquo; rejoined Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;very.
      Have you been here long? Have you seen him? But sit down, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I arrived yesterday,&rdquo; answered Varvara Pavlovna, sitting down meekly. &ldquo;I
      have seen Fedor Ivanitch; I have talked with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Well, and how was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid my sudden arrival would provoke his anger,&rdquo; continued
      Varvara Pavlovna, &ldquo;but he did not refuse to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, he did not... Yes, yes, I understand,&rdquo; commented Marya
      Dmitrievna. &ldquo;He is only a little rough on the surface, but his heart is
      soft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fedor Ivanitch has not forgiven me; he would not hear me. But he was so
      good as to assign me Lavriky as a place of residence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! a splendid estate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am setting off there to-morrow in fulfilment of his wish; but I
      esteemed it a duty to visit you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very, very much obliged to you, my dear. Relations ought never to
      forget one another. And do you know I am surprised how well you speak
      Russian. C&rsquo;est etonnant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been too long abroad, Marya Dmitrievna, I know that; but my heart
      has always been Russian, and I have not forgotten my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah; that is good. Fedor Ivanitch did not, however, expect you at all.
      Yes; you may trust my experience, la patri avant tout. Ah, show me, if you
      please-what a charming mantle you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; Varvara Pavlovna slipped it quickly off her shoulders;
      &ldquo;it is a very simple little thing from Madame Baudran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can see it at once. From Madame Baudran? How sweet, and what taste! I
      am sure you have brought a number of fascinating things with you. If I
      could only see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my things are at your service, dearest auntie. If you permit, I can
      show some patterns to your maid. I have a woman with me from Paris&mdash;a
      wonderfully clever dressmaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good, my dear. But, really, I am ashamed&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed!&rdquo; repeated Varvara Pavlovna reproachfully. &ldquo;If you want to make
      me happy, dispose of me as if I were your property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna was completely melted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vous etes charmante,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you take off your hat and
      gloves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? you will allow me?&rdquo; asked Varvara Pavlovna, and slightly, as though
      with emotion, clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you will dine with us, I hope. I&mdash;I will introduce you to
      my daughter.&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna was a little confused. &ldquo;Well! we are in for
      it! here goes!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;She is not very well to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ma tante, how good you are!&rdquo; cried Varvara Pavlovna, and she raised her
      handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A page announced the arrival of Gedeonovsky. The old gossip came in bowing
      and smiling. Marya Dmitrievna presented him to her visitor. He was thrown
      into confusion for the first moment; but Varvara Pavlovna behaved with
      such coquettish respectfulness to him, that his ears began to tingle, and
      gossip, slander, and civility dropped like honey from his lips. Varvara
      Pavlovna listened to him with a restrained smile and began by degrees to
      talk herself. She spoke modestly of Paris, of her travels, of Baden; twice
      she made Marya Dmitrievna laugh, and each time she sighed a little
      afterwards, and seemed to be inwardly reproaching herself for misplaced
      levity. She obtained permission to bring Ada; taking off her gloves, with
      her smooth hands, redolent of soap a la guimauve, she showed how and where
      flounces were worn and ruches and lace and rosettes. She promised to bring
      a bottle of the new English scent, Victoria Essence; and was as happy as a
      child when Marya Dmitrievna consented to accept it as a gift. She was
      moved to tears over the recollection of the emotion she experienced, when,
      for the first time, she heard the Russian bells. &ldquo;They went so deeply to
      my heart,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Lisa came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since the morning, from the very instant when, chill with horror, she
      had read Lavretsky&rsquo;s note, Lisa had been preparing herself for the meeting
      with his wife. She had a presentiment that she would see her. She resolved
      not to avoid her, as a punishment of her, as she called them, sinful
      hopes. The sudden crisis in her destiny had shaken her to the foundations.
      In some two hours her face seemed to have grown thin. But she did not shed
      a single tear. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I deserve!&rdquo; she said to herself, repressing with
      difficulty and dismay some bitter impulses of hatred which frightened her
      in her soul. &ldquo;Well, I must go down!&rdquo; she thought directly she heard of
      Madame Lavretsky&rsquo;s arrival, and she went down.... She stood a long while
      at the drawing-room door before she could summon up courage to open it.
      With the thought, &ldquo;I have done her wrong,&rdquo; she crossed the threshold and
      forced herself to look at her, forced herself to smile. Varvara Pavlovna
      went to meet her directly she caught sight of her, and bowed to her
      slightly, but still respectfully. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce myself,&rdquo; she
      began in an insinuating voice, &ldquo;your maman is so indulgent to me that I
      hope that you too will be... good to me.&rdquo; The expression of Varvara
      Pavlovna, when she uttered these last words, cold and at the same time
      soft, her hypocritical smile, the action of her hands, and her shoulders,
      her very dress, her whole being aroused such a feeling of repulsion in
      Lisa that she could make no reply to her, and only held out her hand with
      an effort. &ldquo;This young lady disdains me,&rdquo; thought Varvara Pavlovna, warmly
      pressing Lisa&rsquo;s cold fingers, and turning to Marya Dmitrievna, she
      observed in an undertone, &ldquo;mais elle est delicieuse!&rdquo; Lisa faintly
      flushed; she heard ridicule, insult in this exclamation. But she resolved
      not to trust her impressions, and sat down by the window at her
      embroidery-frame. Even here Varvara Pavlovna did not leave her in peace.
      She began to admire her taste, her skill.... Lisa&rsquo;s heart beat violently
      and painfully. She could scarcely control herself, she could scarcely sit
      in her place. It seemed to her that Varvara Pavlovna knew all, and was
      mocking at her in secret triumph. To her relief, Gedeonovsky began to talk
      to Varvara Pavlovna, and drew off her attention. Lisa bent over her frame,
      and secretly watched her. &ldquo;That woman,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;was loved by him.&rdquo;
       But she at once drove away the very thought of Lavretsky; she was afraid
      of losing her control over herself, she felt that her head was going
      round. Marya Dmitrievna began to talk of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard, my dear,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that you are a wonderful performer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is long since I have played,&rdquo; replied Varvara Pavlovna, seating
      herself without delay at the piano, and running her fingers smartly over
      the keys. &ldquo;Do you wish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be so kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna played a brilliant and difficult etude by Hertz very
      correctly. She had great power and execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylphide!&rdquo; cried Gedeonovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna chimed in. &ldquo;Well, Varvara Pavlovna, I
      confess,&rdquo; she observed, for the first time calling her by her name, &ldquo;you
      have astonished me; you might give concerts. We have a musician here, an
      old German, a queer fellow, but a very clever musician. He gives Lisa
      lessons. He will be simply crazy over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisaveta Mihalovna is also musical?&rdquo; asked Varvara Pavlovna, turning her
      head slightly towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she plays fairly, and is fond of music; but what is that beside you?
      But there is one young man here too&mdash;with whom we must make you
      acquainted. He is an artist in soul, and composes very charmingly. He
      alone will be able to appreciate you fully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man?&rdquo; said Varvara Pavlovna: &ldquo;Who is he? Some poor man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no, our chief beau, and not only among us&mdash;et a Petersbourg.
      A kammer-junker, and received in the best society. You must have heard of
      him: Panshin, Vladimir Nikolaitch. He is here on a government commission
      ... future minister, I daresay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And an artist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An artist at heart, and so well-bred. You shall see him. He has been here
      very often of late: I invited him for this evening; I hope he will come,&rdquo;
       added Marya Dmitrievna with a gentle sigh, and an oblique smile of
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa knew the meaning of this smile, but it was nothing to her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And young?&rdquo; repeated Varvara Pavlovna, lightly modulating from tone to
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-eight, and of the most prepossessing appearance. Un jeune homme
      acompli, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An exemplary young man, one may say,&rdquo; observed Gedeonovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna began suddenly playing a noisy waltz of Strauss, opening
      with such a loud and rapid trill that Gedeonovsky was quite startled. In
      the very middle of the waltz she suddenly passed into a pathetic motive,
      and finished up with an air from &ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; Fra poco... She reflected that
      lively music was not in keeping with her position. The air from &ldquo;Lucia,&rdquo;
       with emphasis on the sentimental passages, moved Marya Dmitrievna greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What soul!&rdquo; she observed in an undertone to Gedeonovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sylphide!&rdquo; repeated Gedeonovsky, raising his eyes towards heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner hour arrived. Marfa Timofyevna came down from up-stairs, when
      the soup was already on the table. She treated Varvara Pavlovna very
      drily, replied in half-sentences to her civilities, and did not look at
      her. Varvara Pavlovna soon realised that there was nothing to be got out
      of this old lady, and gave up trying to talk to her. To make up for this,
      Marya Dmitrievna became still more cordial to her guest; her aunt&rsquo;s
      discourtesy irritated her. Marfa Timofyevna, however, did not only avoid
      looking at Varvara Pavlovna; she did not look at Lisa either, though her
      eyes seemed literally blazing. She sat as though she were of stone, yellow
      and pale, her lips compressed, and ate nothing. Lisa seemed calm; and in
      reality, her heart was more at rest, a strange apathy, the apathy of the
      condemned had come upon her. At dinner Varvara Pavlovna spoke little; she
      seemed to have grown timid again, and her countenance was overspread with
      an expression of modest melancholy. Gedeonovsky alone enlivened the
      conversation with his tales, though he constantly looked timorously
      towards Marfa Timofyevna and coughed&mdash;he was always overtaken by a
      fit of coughing when he was going to tell a lie in her presence&mdash;but
      she did not hinder him by any interruption. After dinner it seemed that
      Varvara Pavlovna was quite devoted to preference; at this Marya Dmitrievna
      was so delighted that she felt quite overcome, and thought to herself,
      &ldquo;Really, what a fool Fedor Ivanitch must be; not able to appreciate a
      woman like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down to play cards together with her and Gedeonovsky, and Marfa
      Timofyevna led Lisa away up-stairs with her, saying that she looked
      shocking, and that she must certainly have a headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has an awful headache,&rdquo; observed Marya Dmitrievna, turning to
      Varvara Pavlovna and rolling her eyes, &ldquo;I myself have often just such sick
      headaches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; rejoined Varvara Pavlovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa went into her aunt&rsquo;s room, and sank powerless into a chair. Marfa
      Timofyevna gazed long at her in silence, slowly she knelt down before her&mdash;and
      began still in the same silence to kiss her hands alternately. Lisa bent
      forward, crimsoning&mdash;and began to weep, but she did not make Marfa
      Timofyevna get up, she did not take away her hands, she felt that she had
      not the right to take them away, that she had not the right to hinder the
      old lady from expressing her penitence, and her sympathy, from begging
      forgiveness for what had passed the day before. And Marfa Timofyevna could
      not kiss enough those poor, pale, powerless hands, and silent tears flowed
      from her eyes and from Lisa&rsquo;s; while the cat Matross purred in the wide
      arm-chair among the knitting wool, and the long flame of the little lamp
      faintly stirred and flickered before the holy picture. In the next room,
      behind the door, stood Nastasya Karpovna, and she too was furtively wiping
      her eyes with her check pocket-handkerchief rolled up in a ball.

    <h2>
      Chapter XL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, down-stairs, preference was going on merrily in the
      drawing-room; Marya Dmitrievna was winning, and was in high good-humour. A
      servant came in and announced that Panshin was below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna dropped her cards and moved restlessly in her arm-chair;
      Varvara Pavlovna looked at her with a half-smile, then turned her eyes
      towards the door. Panshin made his appearance in a black frock-coat
      buttoned up to the throat, and a high English collar. &ldquo;It was hard for me
      to obey; but you see I have come,&rdquo; this was what was expressed by his
      unsmiling, freshly shaven countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Woldemar,&rdquo; cried Marya Dmitrievna, &ldquo;you used to come in
      unannounced!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panshin only replied to Marya Dmitrievna by a single glance. He bowed
      courteously to her, but did not kiss her hand. She presented him to
      Varvara Pavlovna; he stepped back a pace, bowed to her with the same
      courtesy, but with still greater elegance and respect, and took a seat
      near the card-table. The game of preference was soon over. Panshin
      inquired after Lisaveta Mihalovna, learnt that she was not quite well, and
      expressed his regret. Then he began to talk to Varvara Pavlovna,
      diplomatically weighing each word and giving it its full value, and
      politely hearing her answers to the end. But the dignity of his diplomatic
      tone did not impress Varvara Pavlovna, and she did not adopt it. On the
      contrary, she looked him in the face with light-hearted attention and
      talked easily, while her delicate nostrils were quivering as though with
      suppressed laughter. Marya Dmitrievna began to enlarge on her talent;
      Panshin courteously inclined his head, so far as his collar would permit
      him, declared that, &ldquo;he felt sure of it beforehand,&rdquo; and almost turned the
      conversation to the diplomatic topic of Metternich himself. Varvara
      Pavlovna, with an expressive look in her velvety eyes, said in a low
      voice, &ldquo;Why, but you too are an artist, un confrere,&rdquo; adding still lower,
      &ldquo;venez!&rdquo; with a nod towards the piano. The single word venez thrown at
      him, instantly, as though by magic, effected a complete transformation in
      Panshin&rsquo;s whole appearance. His care-worn air disappeared; he smiled and
      grew lively, unbuttoned his coat, and repeating &ldquo;a poor artist, alas! Now
      you, I have heard, are a real artist; he followed Varvara Pavlovna to the
      piano....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him sing his song, &lsquo;How the Moon Floats,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you sing?&rdquo; said Varvara Pavlovna, enfolding him in a rapid radiant
      look. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panshin began to cry off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she repeated insistently, tapping on a chair behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, coughed, tugged at his collar, and sang his song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmant,&rdquo; pronounced Varvara Pavlovna, &ldquo;you sing very well, vous avez du
      style, again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked round the piano and stood just opposite Panshin. He sang it
      again, increasing the melodramatic tremor in his voice. Varvara Pavlovna
      stared steadily at him, leaning her elbows on the piano and holding her
      white hands on a level with her lips. Panshin finished the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmant, charmant idee,&rdquo; she said with the calm self-confidence of a
      connoisseur. &ldquo;Tell me, have you composed anything for a woman&rsquo;s voice, for
      a mezzo-soprano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly compose at all,&rdquo; replied Panshin. &ldquo;That was only thrown off in
      the intervals of business... but do you sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sing us something,&rdquo; urged Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna pushed her hair back off her glowing cheeks and gave her
      head a little shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our voices ought to go well together,&rdquo; she observed, turning to Panshin;
      &ldquo;let us sing a duet. Do you know Son geloso, or La ci darem or Mira la
      bianca luna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to sing Mira la bianca luna, once,&rdquo; replied Panshin, &ldquo;but long
      ago; I have forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, we will rehearse it in a low voice. Allow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna sat down at the piano, Panshin stood by her. They sang
      through the duet in an undertone, and Varvara Pavlovna corrected him
      several times as they did so, then they sang it aloud, and then twice
      repeated the performance of Mira la bianca lu-u-na. Varvara Pavlovna&rsquo;s
      voice had lost its freshness, but she managed it with great skill. Panshin
      at first was hesitating, and a little out of tune, then he warmed up, and
      if his singing was not quite beyond criticism, at least he shrugged his
      shoulders, swayed his whole person, and lifted his hand from time to time
      in the most genuine style. Varvara Pavlovna played two or three little
      things of Thalberg&rsquo;s, and coquettishly rendered a little French ballad.
      Marya Dmitrievna did not know how to express her delight; she several
      times tried to send for Lisa. Gedeonovsky, too, was at a loss for words,
      and could only nod his head, but all at once he gave an unexpected yawn,
      and hardly had time to cover his mouth with his! hand. This yawn did not
      escape Varvara Pavlovna; she at once turned her back on the piano,
      observing, &ldquo;Assez de musique comme ca; let us talk,&rdquo; and she folded her
      arms. &ldquo;Oui, assez de musique,&rdquo; repeated Panshin gaily, and at once he
      dropped into a chat, alert, light, and in French. &ldquo;Precisely as in the
      best Parisian salon,&rdquo; thought Marya Dmitrievna, as she listened to their
      fluent and quick-witted sentences. Panshin had a sense of complete
      satisfaction; his eyes shone, and he smiled. At first he passed his hand
      across his face, contracted his brows, and sighed spasmodically whenever
      he chanced to encounter Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s eyes. But later on he forgot
      her altogether, and gave himself up entirely to the enjoyment of a
      half-worldly, half-artistic chat. Varvara Pavlovna proved to be a great
      philosopher; she had a ready answer for everything; she never hesitated,
      never doubted about anything; one could see that she had conversed much
      with clever men of all kinds. All her ideas, all her feelings revolved
      round Paris. Panshin turned the conversation upon literature; it seemed
      that, like himself, she read only French books. George Sand drove her to
      exasperation, Balzac she respected, but he wearied her; in Sue and Scribe
      she saw great knowledge of human nature, Dumas and Feval she adored. In
      her heart she preferred Paul de Kock to all of them, but of course she did
      not even mention his name. To tell the truth, literature had no great
      interest for her. Varvara Pavlovna very skilfully avoided all that could
      even remotely recall her position; there was no reference to love in her
      remarks; on the contrary, they were rather expressive of austerity in
      regard to the allurements of passion, of disillusionment and resignation.
      Panshin disputed with her; she did not agree with him.... but, strange to
      say!... at the very time when words of censure-often of severe censure&mdash;were
      coming from her lips, these words had a soft caressing sound, and her eyes
      spoke... precisely what those lovely eyes spoke, it was hard to say; but
      at least their utterances were anything but severe, and were full of
      undefined sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panshin tried to interpret their secret meaning, he tried to make his own
      eyes speak, but he felt he was not successful; he was conscious that
      Varvara Pavlovna, in the character of a real lioness from abroad, stood
      high above him, and consequently was not completely master of himself.
      Varvara Pavlovna had a habit in conversation of lightly touching the
      sleeve of the person she was talking to; those momentary contacts had a
      most disquieting influence on Vladimir Nikolaitch. Varvara Pavlovna
      possessed the faculty of getting on easily with every one; before two
      hours had passed it seemed to Panshin that he had known her for an age,
      and Lisa, the same Lisa whom, at any-rate, he had loved, to whom he had
      the evening before offered his hand, had vanished as it were into a mist.
      Tea was brought in; the conversation became still more unconstrained.
      Marya Dmitrievna rang for the page and gave orders to ask Lisa to come
      down if her head were better. Panshin, hearing Lisa&rsquo;s name, fell to
      discussing self-sacrifice and the question which was more capable of
      sacrifice&mdash;man or woman. Marya Dmitrievna at once became excited,
      began to maintain that woman is more the ready for sacrifice, declared
      that she would prove it in a couple of words, got confused and finished up
      by a rather unfortunate comparison. Varvara Pavlovna took up a music-book
      and half-hiding behind it and bending towards Panshin, she observed in a
      whisper, as she nibbled a biscuit, with a serene smile on her lips and in
      her eyes, &ldquo;Elle n&rsquo;a pas invente la poudre, la bonne dame.&rdquo; Panshin was a
      little taken aback and amazed at Varvara Pavlovna&rsquo;s audacity; but he did
      not realise how much contempt for himself was concealed in this unexpected
      outbreak, and forgetting Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s kindness and devotion,
      forgetting all the dinners she had given him, and the money she had lent
      him, he replied (luckless mortal!) with the same smile and in the same
      tone, &ldquo;je crois bien,&rdquo; and not even, je crois bien, but j&rsquo;crois ben!
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara flung him a friendly glance and got up. Lisa came in: Marfa
      Timofyevna had tried in vain to hinder her; she was resolved to go through
      with her sufferings to the end. Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her together
      with Panshin, on whose face the former diplomatic expression had
      reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he asked Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am better now, thank you,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been having a little music here; it&rsquo;s a pity you did not hear
      Varvara Pavlovna, she sings superbly, en artiste consommee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, my dear,&rdquo; sounded Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna went to her at once with the submissiveness of a child,
      and sat down on a little stool at her feet. Marya Dmitrievna had called
      her so as to leave her daughter, at least for a moment, alone with
      Panshin; she was still secretly hoping that she would come round. Besides,
      an idea had entered her head, to which she was anxious to give expression
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she whispered to Varvara Pavlovna, &ldquo;I want to endeavour to
      reconcile you and your husband; I won&rsquo;t answer for my success, but I will
      make an effort. He has, you know, a great respect for me.&rdquo; Varvara
      Pavlovna slowly raised her eyes to Marya Dmitrievna, and eloquently
      clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be my saviour, ma tante,&rdquo; she said in a mournful voice: &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know how to thank you for all your kindness; but I have been too
      guilty towards Fedor Ivanitch; he can not forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you&mdash;in reality&mdash;&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna was beginning
      inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t question me,&rdquo; Varvara Pavlovna interrupted her, and she cast down
      her eyes. &ldquo;I was young, frivolous. But I don&rsquo;t want to justify myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, why not try? Don&rsquo;t despair,&rdquo; rejoined Marya Dmitrievna, and
      she was on the point of patting her on the cheek, but after a glance at
      her she had not the courage. &ldquo;She is humble, very humble,&rdquo; she thought,
      &ldquo;but still she is a lioness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; Panshin was saying to Lisa meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; he brought out after a rather protracted silence.
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; Panshin repeated significantly; he simply did not know
      what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa felt embarrassed, and then &ldquo;so be it!&rdquo; she thought. Panshin assumed a
      mysterious air and kept silent, looking severely away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy though it&rsquo;s struck eleven,&rdquo; remarked Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her guests took the hint and began to say good-bye. Varvara Pavlovna had
      to promise that she would come to dinner the following day and bring Ada.
      Gedeonovsky, who had all but fallen asleep sitting in his corner, offered
      to escort her home. Panshin took leave solemnly of all, but at the steps
      as he put Varvara Pavlovna into her carriage he pressed her hand, and
      cried after her, &ldquo;au revoir!&rdquo; Gedeonovsky sat beside her all the way home.
      She amused herself by pressing the tip of her little foot as though
      accidentally on his foot; he was thrown into confusion and began paying
      her compliments. She tittered and made eyes at him when the light of a
      street lamp fell into the carriage. The waltz she had played was ringing
      in her head, and exciting her; whatever position she might find herself
      in, she had only to imagine lights, a ballroom, rapid whirling to the
      strains of music&mdash;and her blood was on fire, her eyes glittered
      strangely, a smile strayed about her lips, and something of bacchanalian
      grace was visible over her whole frame. When she reached home Varvara
      Pavlovna bounded lightly out of the carriage&mdash;only real lionesses
      know how to bound like that&mdash;and turning round to Gedeonovsky she
      burst suddenly into a ringing laugh right in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An attractive person,&rdquo; thought the counsellor of state as he made his way
      to his lodgings, where his servant was awaiting him with a glass of
      opodeldoc: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well I&rsquo;m a steady fellow&mdash;only, what was she
      laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna spent the whole night sitting beside Lisa&rsquo;s bed.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lavretsky spent a day and a half at Vassilyevskoe, and employed almost all
      the time in wandering about the neighbourhood. He could not stop long in
      one place: he was devoured by anguish; he was torn unceasingly by impotent
      violent impulses. He remembered the feeling which had taken possession of
      him the day after his arrival in the country; he remembered his plans then
      and was intensely exasperated with himself. What had been able to tear him
      away from what he recognised as his duty&mdash;as the one task set before
      him in the future? The thirst for happiness&mdash;again the same thirst
      for happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems Mihalevitch was right,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;you wanted a second time to
      taste happiness in life,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;you forgot that it is a
      luxury, an undeserved bliss, if it even comes once to a man. It was not
      complete, it was not genuine, you say; but prove your right to full,
      genuine happiness Look round and see who is happy, who enjoys life about
      you? Look at that peasant going to the mowing; is he contented with his
      fate?... What! would you care to change places with him? Remember your
      mother; how infinitely little she asked of life, and what a life fell to
      her lot. You were only bragging it seems when you said to Panshin that you
      had come back to Russia to cultivate the soil; you have come back to
      dangle after young girls in your old age. Directly the news of your
      freedom came, you threw up everything, forgot everything; you ran like a
      boy after a butterfly.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      The image of Lisa continually presented itself in the midst of his
      broodings. He drove it away with an effort together with another
      importunate figure, other serenely wily, beautiful, hated features. Old
      Anton noticed that the master was not himself: after sighing several times
      outside the door and several times in the doorway, he made up his mind to
      go up to him, and advised him to take a hot drink of something. Lavretsky
      swore at him; ordered him out; afterwards he begged his pardon, but that
      only made Anton still more sorrowful. Lavretsky could not stay in the
      drawing-room; it seemed to him that his great-grandfather Andrey, was
      looking contemptuously from the canvas at his feeble descendant. &ldquo;Bah: you
      swim in shallow water,&rdquo; the distorted lips seemed to be saying. &ldquo;Is it
      possible,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that I cannot master myself, that I am going to
      give in to this... nonsense?&rdquo; (Those who are badly wounded in war always
      call their wounds &ldquo;nonsense.&rdquo; If man did not deceive himself, he could not
      live on earth.) &ldquo;Am I really a boy? Ah, well; I saw quite close, I almost
      held in my hands the possibility of happiness for my whole life; yes, in
      the lottery too&mdash;turn the wheel a little and the beggar perhaps would
      be a rich man. If it does not happen, then it does not&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all
      over. I will set to work, with my teeth clenched, and make myself be
      quiet; it&rsquo;s as well, it&rsquo;s not the first time I have had to hold myself in.
      And why have I run away, why am I stopping here sticking my head in a
      bush, like an ostrich? A fearful thing to face trouble... nonsense!
      Anton,&rdquo; he called aloud, &ldquo;order the coach to be brought round at once.
      Yes,&rdquo; he thought again, &ldquo;I must grin and bear it, I must keep myself well
      in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such reasonings Lavretsky tried to ease his pain; but it was deep and
      intense; and even Apraxya who had outlived all emotion as well as
      intelligence shook her head and followed him mournfully with her eyes, as
      he took his seat in the coach to drive to the town. The horses galloped
      away; he sat upright and motionless, and looked fixedly at the road before
      him.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lisa had written to Lavretsky the day before, to tell him to come in the
      evening; but he first went home to his lodgings. He found neither his wife
      nor his daughter at home; from the servants he learned that she had gone
      with the child to the Kalitins&rsquo;. This information astounded and maddened
      him. &ldquo;Varvara Pavlovna has made up her mind not to let me live at all, it
      seems,&rdquo; he thought with a passion of hatred in his heart. He began to walk
      up and down, and his hands and feet were constantly knocking up against
      child&rsquo;s toys, books and feminine belongings; he called Justine and told
      her to clear away all this &ldquo;litter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oui, monsieur,&rdquo; she said with a
      grimace, and began to set the room in order, stooping gracefully, and
      letting Lavretsky feel in every movement that she regarded him as an
      unpolished bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked with aversion at her faded, but still &ldquo;piquante,&rdquo; ironical,
      Parisian face, at her white elbow-sleeves, her silk apron, and little
      light cap. He sent her away at last, and after long hesitation (as Varvara
      Pavlovna still did not return) he decided to go to the Kalitins&rsquo;&mdash;not
      to see Marya Dmitrievna (he would not for anything in the world have gone
      into that drawing-room, the room where his wife was), but to go up to
      Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s. He remembered that the back staircase from the
      servants&rsquo; entrance led straight to her apartment. He acted on this plan;
      fortune favoured him; he met Shurotchka in the court-yard; she conducted
      him up to Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s. He found her, contrary to her usual habit,
      alone; she was sitting without a cap in a corner, bent, and her arms
      crossed over her breast. The old lady was much upset on seeing Lavretsky,
      she got up quickly and began to move to and fro in the room as if she were
      looking for her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she began, fidgeting about and avoiding meeting his eyes,
      &ldquo;well, how do you do? Well, well, what&rsquo;s to be done! Where were you
      yesterday? Well, she has come, so there, there! Well, it must... one way
      or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky dropped into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sit down, sit down,&rdquo; the old lady went on. &ldquo;Did you come straight
      up-stairs? Well, there, of course. So... you came to see me? Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was silent for a little; Lavretsky did not know what to say
      to her; but she understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa... yes, Lisa was here just now,&rdquo; pursued Marfa Timofyevna, tying and
      untying the tassels of her reticule. &ldquo;She was not quite well. Shurotchka,
      where are you? Come here, my girl; why can&rsquo;t you sit still a little? My
      head aches too. It must be the effect of the singing and music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What singing, auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we have been having those&mdash;upon my word, what do you call them&mdash;duets
      here. And all in Italian: chi-chi&mdash;and cha-cha&mdash;like magpies for
      all the world with their long drawn-out notes as if they&rsquo;d pull your very
      soul out. That&rsquo;s Panshin, and your wife too. And how quickly everything
      was settled; just as though it were all among relations, without ceremony.
      However, one may well say, even a dog will try to find a home; and won&rsquo;t
      be lost so long as folks don&rsquo;t drive it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I confess I did not expect this,&rdquo; rejoined Lavretsky; &ldquo;there must
      be great effrontery to do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my darling, it&rsquo;s not effrontery, it&rsquo;s calculation, God forgive her!
      They say you are sending her off to Lavriky; is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am giving up that property to Varvara Pavlovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she asked you for money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that won&rsquo;t be long in coming. But I have only now got a look at
      you. Are you quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shurotchka!&rdquo; cried Marfa Timofyevna suddenly, &ldquo;run and tell Lisaveta
      Mihalovna,&mdash;at least, no, ask her... is she down-stairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then; ask her where she put my book? she will know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady grew fidgety again and began opening a drawer in the chest.
      Lavretsky sat still without stirring in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once light footsteps were heard on the stairs&mdash;and Lisa came
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky stood up and bowed; Lisa remained at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa, Lisa, darling,&rdquo; began Marfa Timofyevna eagerly, &ldquo;where is my book?
      where did you put my book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What book, auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, goodness me, that book! But I didn&rsquo;t call you though... There, it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter. What are you doing down-stairs? Here Fedor Ivanitch has
      come. How is your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep saying it&rsquo;s nothing. What have you going on down-stairs&mdash;music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;they are playing cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s ready for anything. Shurotchka, I see you want a run in the
      garden&mdash;run along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Marfa Timofyevna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue, if you please, run along. Nastasya Karpovna has gone out
      into the garden all by herself; you keep her company. You must treat the
      old with respect.&rdquo;&mdash;Shurotchka departed&mdash;&ldquo;But where is my cap?
      Where has it got to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me look for it,&rdquo; said Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sit down; I have still the use of my legs. It must be inside in
      my bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And flinging a sidelong glance in Lavretsky&rsquo;s direction, Marfa Timofyevna
      went out. She left the door open; but suddenly she came back to it and
      shut it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa leant back against her chair and quietly covered her face with her
      hands; Lavretsky remained where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is how we were to meet again!&rdquo; he brought out at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa took her hands from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said faintly: &ldquo;we were quickly punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punished,&rdquo; said Lavretsky.... &ldquo;What had you done to be punished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa raised her eyes to him. There was neither sorrow or disquiet
      expressed in them; they seemed smaller and dimmer. Her face was pale; and
      pale too her slightly parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky&rsquo;s heart shuddered for pity and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrote to me; all is over,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;yes, all is over&mdash;before
      it had begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must forget all that,&rdquo; Lisa brought out; &ldquo;I am glad that you have
      come; I wanted to write to you, but it is better so. Only we must take
      advantage quickly of these minutes. It is left for both of us to do our
      duty. You, Fedor Ivanitch, must be reconciled with your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you to do so; by that alone can we expiate... all that has
      happened. You will think about it&mdash;and will not refuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa, for God&rsquo;s sake,&mdash;you are asking what is impossible. I am ready
      to do everything you tell me; but to be reconciled to her now!... I
      consent to everything, I have forgotten everything; but I cannot force my
      heart.... Indeed, this is cruel!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not even ask of you... what you say; do not live with her, if you
      cannot; but be reconciled,&rdquo; replied Lisa and again she hid her eyes in her
      hand.&mdash;&ldquo;remember your little girl; do it for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Lavretsky muttered between his teeth: &ldquo;I will do that, I
      suppose in that I shall fulfill my duty. But you-what does your duty
      consist in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I know myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky started suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot be making up your mind to marry Panshin?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa gave an almost imperceptible smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Lisa, Lisa!&rdquo; cried Lavretsky, &ldquo;how happy you might have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa looked at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you see yourself, Fedor Ivanitch, that happiness does not depend on
      us, but on God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door from the adjoining room opened quickly and Marfa Timofyevna came
      in with her cap in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found it at last,&rdquo; she said, standing between Lavretsky and Lisa;
      &ldquo;I had laid it down myself. That&rsquo;s what age does for one, alack&mdash;though
      youth&rsquo;s not much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and are you going to Lavriky yourself with your wife?&rdquo; she added,
      turning to Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Lavriky with her? I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going down-stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, you know best; but you, Lisa, I think, ought to go down. Ah,
      merciful powers, I have forgotten to feed my bullfinch. There, stop a
      minute, I&rsquo;ll soon&mdash;&rdquo; And Marfa Timofyevna ran off without putting on
      her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky walked quickly up to Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa,&rdquo; he began in a voice of entreaty, &ldquo;we are parting for ever, my
      heart is torn,&mdash;give me your hand at parting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa raised her head, her wearied eyes, their light almost extinct, rested
      upon him.... &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she uttered, and she drew back the hand she was holding
      out. &ldquo;No, Lavretsky (it was the first time she had used this name), I will
      not give you my hand. What is the good? Go away, I beseech you. You know I
      love you... yes, I love you,&rdquo; she added with an effort; &ldquo;but no... no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her handkerchief to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me, at least, that handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door creaked... the handkerchief slid on to Lisa&rsquo;s lap. Lavretsky
      snatched it before it had time to fall to the floor, thrust it quickly
      into a side pocket, and turning round met Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa, darling, I fancy your mother is calling you,&rdquo; the old lady
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa at once got up and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna sat down again in her corner. Lavretsky began to take
      leave of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fedor,&rdquo; she said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an honest man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you, are you an honest man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. But give me your word of honour that you will be an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why. And you too, my dear friend, if you think well, you&rsquo;re no
      fool&mdash;will understand why I ask it of you. And now, good-bye, my
      dear. Thanks for your visit; and remember you have given your word, Fedya,
      and kiss me. Oh, my dear, it&rsquo;s hard for you, I know; but there, it&rsquo;s not
      easy for any one. Once I used to envy the flies; I thought it&rsquo;s for them
      it&rsquo;s good to be alive but one night I heard a fly complaining in a
      spider&rsquo;s web&mdash;no, I think, they too have their troubles. There&rsquo;s no
      help, Fedya; but remember your promise all the same. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky went down the back staircase, and had reached the gates when a
      man-servant overtook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marya Dmitrievna told me to ask you to go in to her,&rdquo; he commenced to
      Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her, my boy, that just now I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Fedor Ivanitch was
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her excellency told me to ask you very particularly,&rdquo; continued the
      servant. &ldquo;She gave orders to say she was at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the visitors gone?&rdquo; asked Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; replied the servant with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky shrugged his shoulders and followed him.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna was sitting alone in her boudoir in an easy-chair,
      sniffing eau de cologne; a glass of orange-flower-water was standing on a
      little table near her. She was agitated and seemed nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me,&rdquo; he said, bowing coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Marya Dmitrievna, and she sipped a little water: &ldquo;I heard
      that you had gone straight up to my aunt; I gave orders that you should be
      asked to come in; I wanted to have a little talk with you. Sit down,
      please,&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna took breath. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;your wife
      has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was aware of that,&rdquo; remarked Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, that is, I wanted to say, she came to me, and I received her;
      that is what I wanted to explain to you, Fedor Ivanitch. Thank God I have,
      I may say, gained universal respect, and for no consideration in the world
      would I do anything improper. Though I foresaw that it would be
      disagreeable to you, still I could not make up my mind to deny myself to
      her, Fedor Ivanitch; she is a relation of mine&mdash;through you; put
      yourself in my position, what right had I to shut my doors on her&mdash;you
      will agree with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are exciting yourself needlessly, Mary Dmitrievna,&rdquo; replied
      Lavretsky; &ldquo;you acted very well, I am not angry. I have not the least
      intention of depriving Varvara Pavlovna of the opportunity of seeing her
      friends; I did not come in to you to-day simply because I did not care to
      meet her&mdash;that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how glad I am to hear you say that, Fedor Ivanitch,&rdquo; cried Marya
      Dmitrievna, &ldquo;but I always expected it of your noble sentiments. And as for
      my being excited&mdash;that&rsquo;s not to be wondered at; I am a woman and a
      mother. And your wife... of course I cannot judge between you and her&mdash;as
      I said to her herself; but she is such a delightful woman that she can
      produce nothing but a pleasant impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky gave a laugh and played with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is what I wanted to say to you besides, Fedor Ivanitch,&rdquo;
       continued Marya Dmitrievna, moving slightly nearer up to him, &ldquo;if you had
      seen the modesty of her behaviour, how respectful she is! Really, it is
      quite touching. And if you had heard how she spoke of you! I have been to
      blame towards him, she said, altogether; I did not know how to appreciate
      him, she said; he is an angel, she said, and not a man. Really, that is
      what she said&mdash;an angel. Her penitence is such... Ah, upon my word, I
      have never seen such penitence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Marya Dmitrievna,&rdquo; observed Lavretsky, &ldquo;if I may be inquisitive: I
      am told that Varvara Pavlovna has been singing in your drawing-room; did
      she sing during the time of her penitence, or how was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I wonder you are not ashamed to talk like that! She sang and played
      the piano only to do me a kindness, because I positively entreated, almost
      commanded her to do so. I saw that she was sad, so sad; I thought how to
      distract her mind&mdash;and I heard that she had such marvellous talent! I
      assure you, Fedor Ivanitch, she is utterly crushed, ask Sergei Petrovitch
      even; a heart-broken woman, tout a fait: what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky only shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then what a little angel is that Adotchka of yours, what a darling!
      How sweet she is, what a clever little thing; how she speaks French; and
      understand Russian too&mdash;she called me &lsquo;auntie&rsquo; in Russian. And you
      know that as for shyness&mdash;almost all children at her age are shy&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      not a trace of it. She&rsquo;s so like you, Fedor Ivanitch, it&rsquo;s amazing. The
      eyes, the forehead&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s you over again, precisely you. I am
      not particularly fond of little children, I must own; but I simply lost my
      heart to your little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marya Dmitrievna,&rdquo; Lavretsky blurted out suddenly, &ldquo;allow me to ask you
      what is your object in talking to me like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What object?&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna sniffed her eau de cologne again, and took
      a sip of water. &ldquo;Why, I am speaking to you, Fedor Ivanitch, because&mdash;I
      am a relation of yours, you know, I take the warmest interest in you&mdash;I
      know your heart is of the best. Listen to me, mon cousin. I am at any rate
      a woman of experience, and I shall not talk at random: forgive her,
      forgive your wife.&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s eyes suddenly filled with tears.
      &ldquo;Only think: her youth, her inexperience... and who knows, perhaps, bad
      example; she had not a mother who could bring her up in the right way.
      Forgive her, Fedor Ivanitch, she has been punished enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears were trickling down Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s cheeks: she did not wipe
      them away, she was fond of weeping. Lavretsky sat as if on thorns. &ldquo;Good
      God,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what torture, what a day I have had to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make no reply,&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna began again. &ldquo;How am I to understand
      you? Can you really be so cruel? No, I will not believe it. I feel that my
      words have influenced you, Fedor Ivanitch. God reward you for your
      goodness, and now receive your wife from my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Lavretsky jumped up from his chair; Marya Dmitrievna also
      rose and running quickly behind a screen, she led forth Varvara Pavlovna.
      Pale, almost lifeless, with downcast eyes, she seemed to have renounced
      all thought, all will of her own, and to have surrendered herself
      completely to Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky stepped back a pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been here all the time!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not blame her,&rdquo; explained Marya Dmitrievna; &ldquo;she was most unwilling to
      stay, but I forced her to remain. I put her behind the screen. She assured
      me that this would only anger you more; I would not even listen to her; I
      know you better than she does. Take your wife back from my hands; come,
      Varya, do not fear, fall at your husband&rsquo;s feet (she gave a pull at her
      arm) and my blessing&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute, Marya Dmitrievna,&rdquo; said Lavretsky in a low but startlingly
      impressive voice. &ldquo;I dare say you are fond of affecting scenes&rdquo; (Lavretsky
      was right, Marya Dmitrievna still retained her school-girl&rsquo;s passion for a
      little melodramatic effect), &ldquo;they amuse you; but they may be anything but
      pleasant for other people. But I am not going to talk to you; in this
      scene you are not the principal character. What do you want to get out of
      me, madam?&rdquo; he added, turning to his wife. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I done all I could for
      you? Don&rsquo;t tell me you did not contrive this interview; I shall not
      believe you&mdash;and you know that I cannot possibly believe you. What is
      it you want? You are clever&mdash;you do nothing without an object. You
      must realise, that as for living with, as I once lived with you, that I
      cannot do; not because I am angry with you, but because I have become a
      different man. I told you so the day after your return, and you yourself,
      at that moment, agreed with me in your! heart. But you want to reinstate
      yourself in public opinion; it is not enough for you to live in my house,
      you want to live with me under the same roof&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want your forgiveness,&rdquo; pronounced Varvara Pavlovna, not raising her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants your forgiveness,&rdquo; repeated Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not for my own sake, but for Ada&rsquo;s,&rdquo; murmured Varvara Pavlovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not for her own sake, but for your Ada&rsquo;s,&rdquo; repeated Marya Dmitrievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Is that what you want?&rdquo; Lavretsky uttered with an effort.
      &ldquo;Certainly, I consent to that too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna darted a swift glance at him, but Marya Dmitrievna cried:
      &ldquo;There, God be thanked!&rdquo; and again drew Varvara Pavlvona forward by the
      arm. &ldquo;Take her now from my arms&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute, I tell you,&rdquo; Lavretsky interrupted her, &ldquo;I agree to live
      with you, Varvara Pavlovna,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that is to say, I will conduct
      you to Lavriky, and I will live there with you, as long as I can endure
      it, and then I will go away&mdash;and will come back again. You see, I do
      not want to deceive you; but do not demand anything more. You would laugh
      yourself if I were to carry out the desire of our respected cousin, were
      to press you to my breast, and to fall to assuring you that ... that the
      past had not been; and the felled tree can bud again. But I see, I must
      submit. You will not understand these words... but that&rsquo;s no matter. I
      repeat, I will live with you... or no, I cannot promise that... I will be
      reconciled with you, I will regard you as my wife again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her, at least your hand on it,&rdquo; observed Marya Dmitrievna, whose
      tears had long since dried up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never deceived Varvara Pavlovna hitherto,&rdquo; returned Lavretsky;
      &ldquo;she will believe me without that. I will take her to Lavriky; and
      remember, Varvara Pavlovna, our treaty is to be reckoned as broken
      directly you go away from Lavriky. And now allow me to take leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to both the ladies, and hurriedly went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not going to take her with you!&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna cried after
      him.... &ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; Varvara Pavlovna whispered to her. And at once
      she embraced her, and began thanking her, kissing her hands and calling
      her saviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marya Dmitrievna received her caresses indulgently; but at heart she was
      discontented with Lavretsky, with Varvara Pavlovna, and with the whole
      scene she had prepared. Very little sentimentality had come of it; Varvara
      Pavlovna, in her opinion, ought to have flung herself at her husband&rsquo;s
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it you didn&rsquo;t understand me?&rdquo; she commented: &ldquo;I kept saying
      &lsquo;down.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better as it was, dear auntie; do not be uneasy&mdash;it was all
      for the best,&rdquo; Varvara Pavlovna assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, any way, he&rsquo;s as cold as ice,&rdquo; observed Marya Dmitrievna. &ldquo;You
      didn&rsquo;t weep, it is true, but I was in floods of tears before his eyes. He
      wants to shut you up at Lavriky. Why, won&rsquo;t you even be able to come and
      see me? All men are unfeeling,&rdquo; she concluded, with a significant shake of
      the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then women can appreciate goodness and noble-heartedness,&rdquo; said
      Varvara Pavlovna, and gently dropping on her knees before Marya
      Dmitrievna, she flung her arms about her round person, and pressed her
      face against it. That face wore a sly smile, but Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s tears
      began to flow again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lavretsky returned home, he locked himself in his valet&rsquo;s room, and
      flung himself on a sofa; he lay like that till morning.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following day was Sunday. The sound of bells ringing for early mass
      did not wake Lavretsky&mdash;he had not closed his eyes all night&mdash;but
      it reminded him of another Sunday, when at Lisa&rsquo;s desire he had gone to
      church. He got up hastily; some secret voice told him that he would see
      her there to-day. He went noiselessly out of the house, leaving a message
      for Varvara Pavlovna that he would be back to dinner, and with long
      strides he made his way in the direction in which the monotonously
      mournful bells were calling him. He arrived early; there was scarcely any
      one in the church; a deacon was reading the service in the chair; the
      measured drone of his voice&mdash;sometimes broken by a cough&mdash;fell
      and rose at even intervals. Lavretsky placed himself not far from the
      entrance. Worshippers came in one by one, stopped, crossed themselves, and
      bowed in all directions; their steps rang out in the empty, silent church,
      echoing back distinctly under the arched roof. An infirm poor little old
      woman in a worn-out cloak with a hood was on her knees near Lavretsky,
      praying assiduously; her toothless, yellow, wrinkled face expressed
      intense emotion; her red eyes were gazing fixedly upwards at the holy
      figures on the iconostasis; her bony hand was constantly coming out from
      under her cloak, and slowly and earnestly making a great sign of the
      cross. A peasant with a bushy beard and a surly face, dishevelled and
      unkempt, came into the church, and at once fell on both knees, and began
      directly crossing himself in haste, bending back his head with a shake
      after each prostration. Such bitter grief was expressed in his face, and
      in all his actions, that Lavretsky made up his mind to go up to him and
      ask him what was wrong. The peasant timidly and morosely started back,
      looked at him.... &ldquo;My son is dead,&rdquo; he articulated quickly, and again fell
      to bowing to the earth. &ldquo;What could replace the consolations of the Church
      to them?&rdquo; thought Lavretsky; and he tried! himself to pray, but his heart
      was hard and heavy, and his thoughts were far away. He kept expecting
      Lisa, but Lisa did not come. The church began to be full of people; but
      still she was not there. The service commenced, the deacon had already
      read the gospel, they began ringing for the last prayer; Lavretsky moved a
      little forward&mdash;and suddenly caught sight of Lisa. She had com before
      him, but he had not seen her; she was hidden in a recess between the wall
      and the choir, and neither moved nor looked round. Lavretsky did not take
      his eyes off he till the very end of the service; he was saying farewell
      to her. The people began to disperse, but she still remained; it seemed as
      though she were waiting for Lavretsky to go out. At last she crossed
      herself for the last time and went out&mdash;there was only a maid with
      her&mdash;not turning round. Lavretsky went out of the church after her
      and overtook her in the street; she was walking very quickly, with
      downcast head, and a veil over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Lisaveta Mihalovna,&rdquo; he said aloud with assumed
      carelessness: &ldquo;may I accompany you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply; he walked beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you content with me?&rdquo; he asked her, dropping his voice. &ldquo;Have you
      heard what happened yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she replied in a whisper, &ldquo;that was well.&rdquo; And she went still
      more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you content?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa only bent her head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fedor Ivanitch,&rdquo; she began in a calm but faint voice, &ldquo;I wanted to beg
      you not to come to see us any more; go away as soon as possible, we may
      see each other again later&mdash;sometime&mdash;in a year. But now, do
      this for my sake; fulfil my request, for God&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to obey you in everything, Lisaveta Mihalovna; but are we
      really to part like this? will you not say one word to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fedor Ivanitch, you are walking near me now.... But already you are so
      far from me. And not only you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out, I entreat you!&rdquo; cried Lavretsky, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will hear perhaps... but whatever it may be, forget... no, do not
      forget; remember me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me forget you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, good-bye. Do not come after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisa!&rdquo; Lavretsky was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye!&rdquo; she repeated, pulling her veil still lower and
      almost running forward. Lavretsky looked after her, and with bowed head,
      turned back along the street. He stumbled up against Lemm, who was also
      walking along with his eyes on the ground, and his hat pulled down to his
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have you to say?&rdquo; Lavretsky brought out at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I to say?&rdquo; returned Lemm, grimly. &ldquo;I have nothing to say. All
      is dead, and we are dead (Alles ist todt, und wir sind todt). So you&rsquo;re
      going to the right, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I go to the left. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following morning Fedor Ivanitch set off with his wife for Lavriky.
      She drove in front in the carriage with Ada and Justine; he behind, in the
      coach. The pretty little girl did not move away from the window the whole
      journey; she was astonished at everything; the peasants, the women, the
      wells, the yokes over the horses&rsquo; heads, the bells and the flocks of
      crows. Justine shared her wonder. Varvara Pavlovna laughed at their
      remarks and exclamations. She was in excellent spirits; before leaving
      town, she had come to an explanation with her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your position,&rdquo; she said to him, and from the look in her
      subtle eyes, he was able to infer that she understood his position fully,
      &ldquo;but you must do me, at least, this justice, that I am easy to live with;
      I will not fetter you or hinder you; I wanted to secure Ada&rsquo;s future, I
      want nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have obtained your object,&rdquo; observed Fedor Ivanitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only dream of one thing now: to hide myself for ever in obscurity. I
      shall remember your goodness always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of that,&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall know how to respect your independence and tranquillity,&rdquo; she
      went on, completing the phrases she had prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky made her a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Pavlovna then believed her husband was thanking her in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the next day they reached Lavriky; a week later,
      Lavretsky set off for Moscow, leaving his wife five thousand roubles for
      her household expenses; and the day after Lavretsky&rsquo;s departure, Panshin
      made his appearance. Varvara Pavlovna had begged him not to forget her in
      her solitude. She gave him the best possible reception, and, till a late
      hour of the night, the lofty apartments of the house and even the garden
      re-echoed with the sound of music, singing, and lively French talk. For
      three days Varvara Pavlovna entertained Panshin; when he took leave of
      her, warmly pressing her lovely hands, he promised to come back very soon&mdash;and
      he kept his word.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lisa had a room to herself on the second story of her mother&rsquo;s house, a
      clean bright little room with a little white bed, with pots of flowers in
      the corners and before the windows, a small writing-table, a book-stand,
      and a crucifix on the wall. It was always called the nursery; Lisa had
      been born in it. When she returned from the church where she had seen
      Lavretsky she set everything in her room in order more carefully than
      usual, dusted it everywhere, looked through and tied up with ribbon all
      her copybooks, and the letters of her girl-friends, shut up all the
      drawers, watered the flowers and caressed every blossom with her hand. All
      this she did without haste, noiselessly, with a kind of rapt and gentle
      solicitude on her face. She topped at last in the middle of the room,
      slowly looked around, and going up to the table above which the crucifix
      was hanging, she fell on her knees, dropped her head on to her clasped
      hands and remained motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna came in and found her in this position. Lisa did not
      observe her entrance. The old lady stepped out on tip-toe and coughed
      loudly several times outside the door. Lisa rose quickly and wiped her
      eyes, which were bright with unshed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see, you have been setting your cell to rights again,&rdquo; observed
      Marfa Timofyevna, and she bent low over a young rose-tree in a pot; &ldquo;how
      nice it smells!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa looked thoughtfully at her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange you should use that word!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What word, eh?&rdquo; the old lady returned quickly. &ldquo;What do you mean? This is
      horrible,&rdquo; she began, suddenly flinging off her cap and sitting down on
      Lisa&rsquo;s little bed; &ldquo;it is more than I can bear! this is the fourth day now
      that I have been boiling over inside; I can&rsquo;t pretend not to notice any
      longer; I can&rsquo;t see you getting pale, and fading away, and weeping, I
      can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter, auntie?&rdquo; said Lisa, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; cried Marfa Timofyevna; &ldquo;you may tell that to others but not to
      me. Nothing, who was on her knees just to this minute? and whose eyelashes
      are still wet with tears? Nothing, indeed! why, look at yourself, what
      have you done with your face, what has become of your eyes?&mdash;Nothing!
      do you suppose I don&rsquo;t know all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will pass off, auntie; give me time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will pass of, but when? Good God! Merciful Saviour! can you have loved
      him like this? why, he&rsquo;s an old man, Lisa, darling. There, I don&rsquo;t dispute
      he&rsquo;s a good fellow, no harm in him; but what of that? we are all good
      people, the world is not so small, there will be always plenty of that
      commodity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, it will all pass away, it has all passed away already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Lisa, darling, what I am going to say to you,&rdquo; Marfa Timofyevna
      said suddenly, making Lisa sit beside her, and straightening her hair and
      her neckerchief. &ldquo;It seems to you now in the mist of the worst of it that
      nothing can ever heal your sorrow. Ah, my darling, the only thing that
      can&rsquo;t be cured is death. You only say to yourself now: &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t give in to
      it&mdash;so there!&rsquo; and you will be surprised yourself how soon, how
      easily it will pass of. Only have patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; returned Lisa, &ldquo;it has passed off already, it is all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passed! how has it passed? Why, your poor little nose has grown sharp
      already and you say it is over. A fine way of getting over it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is over, auntie, if you will only try to help me,&rdquo; Lisa declared
      with sudden animation, and she flung herself on Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s neck.
      &ldquo;Dar auntie, be a friend to me, help me, don&rsquo;t be angry, understand me&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is it, what is it, my good girl? Don&rsquo;t terrify me, please; I
      shall scream directly; don&rsquo;t look at me like that; tell me quickly, what
      is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I want,&rdquo; Lisa hid her face on Marfa Timofyevna&rsquo;s bosom, &ldquo;I want
      to go into a convent,&rdquo; she articulated faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady almost bounded off the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cross yourself, my girl, Lisa, dear, think what you are saying; what are
      you thinking of? God have mercy on you!&rdquo; she stammered at last. &ldquo;Lie down,
      my darling, sleep a little, all this comes from sleeplessness, my dearie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisa raised her head, her cheeks were glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, auntie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak like that; I have made up my mind, I
      prayed, I asked counsel of God; all is at an end, my life with you is at
      an end. Such a lesson was not for nothing; and it is not the first time
      that I have thought of it. Happiness was not for me; even when I had hopes
      of happiness, my heart was always heavy. I knew all my own sins and those
      of others, and how papa made our fortune; I know it all. For all that
      there must be expiation. I am sorry for you, sorry for mamma, for
      Lenotchka; but there is no help; I feel that there is no living here for
      me; I have taken leave of all, I have greeted everything in the house for
      the last time; something calls to me; I am sick at heart, I want to hide
      myself away for ever. Do not hinder me, do not dissuade me, help me, or
      else I must go away alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Timofyevna listened to her niece with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is ill, she is raving,&rdquo; she thought: &ldquo;we must send for a doctor; but
      for which one? Gedeonovsky was praising one the other day; he always tells
      lies&mdash;but perhaps this time he spoke the truth.&rdquo; But when she was
      convinced that Lisa was not ill, and was not raving, when she constantly
      made the same answer to all her expostulations, Marfa Timofyevna was
      alarmed and distressed in earnest. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know, my darling,&rdquo; she
      began to reason with her, &ldquo;what a life it is in those convents! Why, they
      would feed you, my own, on green hemp oil, and they would put you in the
      coarsest linen, and make you go about in the cold; you will never be able
      to bear all that, Lisa, darling. All this is Agafya&rsquo;s doing; she led you
      astray. But then you know she began by living and lived for her own
      pleasure; you must live, too. At least, let me die in peace, and then do
      as you like. And who has ever heard of such a thing, for the sake of such
      a&mdash;for the sake of a goat&rsquo;s beard, God forgive us!&mdash;for the sake
      of a man&mdash;to go into a convent! Why, if you are so sick at heart, go
      on a pilgrimage, offer prayers to some saint, have a Te Deum sung, but
      don&rsquo;t put the black hood on your head, my dear creature, my good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Marfa Timofyevna wept bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa comforted her, wiped away her tears and wept herself, but remained
      unshaken. In her despair Marfa Timofyevna had recourse to threats: to tell
      her mother all about it... but that too was of no avail. Only at the old
      lady&rsquo;s most earnest entreaties Lisa agreed to put off carrying out her
      plan for six months. Marfa Timofyevna was obliged to promise in return
      that if, within six months, she did not change her mind, she would herself
      help her and would do all she could to gain Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her promise to bury herself in seclusion, at the first
      approach of cold weather, Varvara Pavlovna, having provided herself with
      funds, removed to Petersburg, where she took a modest but charming set of
      apartments, found for her by Panshin; who had left the O&mdash;&mdash;-district
      a little before. During the latter part of his residence in O&mdash;&mdash;-
      he had completely lost Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s good graces; he had suddenly
      given up visiting her and scarcely stirred from Lavriky. Varvara Pavolvna
      had enslaved him, literally enslaved him, no other word can describe her
      boundless, irresistible, unquestioned sway over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky spent the winter in Moscow; and in the spring of the following
      year the news reached him that Lisa had taken the veil in the B&mdash;&mdash;-convent,
      in one of the remote parts of Russia.

    <h2>
      Epilogue
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eight years had passed by. Once more the spring had come.... But we will
      say a few words first of the fate of Mihalevitch, Panshin, and Madame
      Laverestky&mdash;and then take leave of them. Mihalevitch, after long
      wanderings, has at last fallen in with exactly the right work for him; he
      has received the position of senior superintendent of a government school.
      He is very well content with his lot; his pupils adore him, though they
      mimick him too. Panshin has gained great advancement in rank, and already
      has a directorship in view; he walks with a slight stoop, caused doubtless
      by the weight round his neck of the Vladimir cross which has been
      conferred on him. The official in him has finally gained the ascendency
      over the artist; his still youngish face has grown yellow, and his hair
      scanty; he now neither sings nor sketches, but applies himself in secret
      to literature; he has written a comedy, in the style of a &ldquo;proverb,&rdquo; and
      as nowadays all writers have to draw a portrait of some one or something,
      he has drawn in it the portrait of a coquette, and he reads it privately
      to two or three ladies who look kindly upon him. He has, however, not
      entered upon matrimony, though many excellent opportunities of doing so
      have presented themselves. For this Varvara Pavlovna was responsible. As
      for her, she lives constantly at Paris, as in former days. Fedor Ivanitch
      has given her a promissory note for a large sum, and has so secured
      immunity from the possibility of her making a second sudden descent upon
      him. She has grown older and stouter, but is still charming and elegant.
      Every one has his ideal. Varvara Pavlovna found hers in the dramatic works
      of M. Dumas Fils. She diligently frequents the theatres, when consumptive
      and sentimental &ldquo;dames aux camelias&rdquo; are brought on the stage; to be
      Madame Doche seems to her the height of human bliss; she once declared
      that she did not desire a better fate for her own daughter. It is to be
      hoped that fate will spare Mademoiselle Ada from such happiness; from a
      rosy-cheeked, chubby child she has turned into a weak-chested, pale girl;
      her nerves are already deranged. The number of Varvara Pavlovna adorers
      has diminished, but she still has some; a few she will probably retain to
      the end of her days. The most ardent of them in these later days is a
      certain Zakurdalo-Skubrinikov, a retired guardsman, a full-bearded man of
      thirty-eight, of exceptionally vigorous physique. The French habitues of
      Madame Lavretsky&rsquo;s salon call him &ldquo;le gros taureau de l&rsquo;Ukraine;&rdquo; Varvara
      Pavlovna never invites him to her fashionable evening reunions, but he is
      in the fullest enjoyment of her favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so&mdash;eight years have passed by. Once more the breezes of spring
      breathed brightness and rejoicing from the heavens; once more spring was
      smiling upon the earth and upon men; once more under her caresses
      everything was turning to blossom, to love, to song. The town of O&mdash;&mdash;-had
      undergone little change in the course of these eight years; but Marya
      Dmitrievna&rsquo;s house seemed to have grown younger; its freshly-painted walls
      gave a bright welcome, and the panes of its open windows were crimson,
      shining in the setting sun; from these windows the light merry sound of
      ringing young voices and continual laughter floated into the street; the
      whole house seemed astir with life and brimming over with gaiety. The lady
      of the house herself had long been in her tomb; Marya Dmitrievna had died
      two years after Lisa took the veil, and Mafa Timofyevna had not long
      survived her niece; they lay side by side in the cemetery of the town.
      Nastasya Karpovna too was no more; for several years! the faithful old
      woman had gone every week to say a prayer over her friend&rsquo;s ashes..... Her
      time had come, and now her bones too lay in the damp earth. But Marya
      Dmitreivna&rsquo;s house had not passed into stranger&rsquo;s hands, it had not gone
      out of her family, the home had not been broken upon. Lenotchka,
      transformed into a slim, beautiful young girl, and her betrothed lover&mdash;a
      fair-haired officer of hussars; Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s son, who had just been
      married in Petersburg and had come with his young wife for the spring to O&mdash;&mdash;-;
      his wife&rsquo;s sister, a school-girl of sixteen, with glowing cheeks and
      bright eyes; Shurotchka, grown up and also pretty, made up the youthful
      household, whose laughter and talk set the walls of the Kalitins&rsquo; house
      resounding. Everything in the house was changed, everything was in keeping
      with its new inhabitants. Beardless servant lads, grinning and full of
      fun, had replaced the sober old servants of former days. Two setter dogs
      dashed wildly about and gambolled over the sofas, where the fat Roska had
      at one time waddled in solemn dignity. The stables were filled with
      slender racers, spirited carriage horses, fiery out-riders with plaited
      manes, and riding horses from the Don. The breakfast, dinner, and
      supper-hours were all in confusion and disorder; in the words of the
      neighbours, &ldquo;unheard-of arrangements&rdquo; were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of which we are speaking, the inhabitants of the Kalitins&rsquo; 
      house (the eldest of them, Lenotchka&rsquo;s betrothed, was only twenty-four)
      were engaged in a game, which, though not of a very complicated nature,
      was, to judge from their merry laughter, exceedingly entertaining to them;
      they were running about the rooms, chasing one another; the dogs, too,
      were running and barking, and the canaries, hanging in cages above the
      windows, were straining their throats in rivalry and adding to the general
      uproar by the shrill trilling of their piercing notes. At the very height
      of this deafening merry-making a mud-bespattered carriage stopped at the
      gate, and a man of five-and forty, in a travelling dress, stepped out of
      it and stood still in amazement. He stood a little time without stirring,
      watching the house with attentive eyes; then went through the little gate
      in the courtyard, and slowly mounted the steps. In the hall he met no one;
      but the door of a room was suddenly! flung open, and out of it rushed
      Shurotchka, flushed and hot, and instantly, with a ringing shout, all the
      young party in pursuit of her. They stopped short at once and were quiet
      at the sight of a stranger; but their clear eyes fixed on him wore the
      same friendly expression, and their fresh faces were still smiling as
      Marya Dmitreivna&rsquo;s son went up to the visitor and asked him cordially what
      he could do for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Lavretsky,&rdquo; replied the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by a shout in chorus&mdash;and not because these young
      people were greatly delighted at the arrival of a distant, almost
      forgotten relation, but simply because they were ready to be delighted and
      make noise at every opportunity. They surrounded Lavretsky at once;
      Lenotchka, as an old acquaintance, was the first to mention her own name,
      and assured him that in a little while she would have certainly recognised
      him. She presented him to the rest of the party, calling each, even her
      betrothed, by their pet names. They all trooped through the dining-room
      into the drawing-room. The walls of both rooms had been repapered; but the
      furniture remained the same. Lavretsky recognised the piano; even the
      embroidery-frame in the window was just the same, and in the same
      position, and it seemed with the same unfinished embroidery on it, as
      eight years ago. They made him sit down in a comfortable arm-chair; all
      sat down politely in a circle round him. Questions, exclamations, and
      anecdotes followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time since we have seen you,&rdquo; observed Lenotchka simply, &ldquo;and
      Varvara Pavlovna we have seen nothing of either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no wonder!&rdquo; her brother hastened to interpose. &ldquo;I carried you off
      to Petersburg, and Fedor Ivanitch has been living all the time in the
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and mamma died soon after then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Marfa Timofyevna,&rdquo; observed Shurotchka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Nastasya Karpovna,&rdquo; added Lenotchka, &ldquo;and Monsier Lemm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? is Lemm dead?&rdquo; inquired Lavretsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied young Kalitin, &ldquo;he left here for Odessa; they say some one
      enticed him there; and there he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know,... did he leave any music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; not very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All were silent and looked about them. A slight cloud of melancholy
      flitted over all the young faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Matross is alive,&rdquo; said Lenotchka suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gedeonovsky,&rdquo; added her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Gedeonovsky&rsquo;s name a merry laugh broke out at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is alive, and as great a liar as ever,&rdquo; Marya Dmitrievna&rsquo;s son
      continued; &ldquo;and only fancy, yesterday this madcap&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the
      school-girl, his wife&rsquo;s sister&mdash;&ldquo;put some pepper in his snuff-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How he did sneeze!&rdquo; cried Lenotchka, and again there was a burst of
      unrestrained laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had news of Lisa lately,&rdquo; observed young Kalitin, and again a
      hush fell upon all; &ldquo;there was good news of her; she is recovering her
      health a little now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is still in the same convent?&rdquo; Lavretsky asked, not without some
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, still in the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she write to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never; but we get news through other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden and profound silence followed. &ldquo;A good angel is passing over,&rdquo;
       all were thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go into the garden?&rdquo; said Kalitin, turning to
      Lavretsky; &ldquo;it is very nice now, though we have let it run wild a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky went out into the garden, and the first thing that met his eyes
      was the very garden seat on which he had once spent with Lisa those few
      blissful moments, never repeated; it had grown black and warped; but he
      recognised it, and his soul was filled with that emotion, unequalled for
      sweetness and for bitterness&mdash;the emotion of keen sorrow for vanished
      youth, for the happiness which has once been possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked along the avenues with the young people; the lime-trees looked
      hardly older or taller in the eight years, but their shade was thicker; on
      the other hand, all the bushes had sprung up, the raspberry bushes had
      grown strong, the hazels were tangled thicket, and from all sides rose the
      fresh scent of the trees and grass and lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would be a nice place for Puss-in-the-Corner,&rdquo; cried Lenotchka
      suddenly, as they came upon a small green lawn, surrounded by lime-trees,
      &ldquo;and we are just five, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten Fedor Ivanitch?&rdquo; replied her brother,... &ldquo;or didn&rsquo;t
      you count yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lenotchka blushed slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would Fedor Ivanitch, at his age&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, play your games,&rdquo; Lavretsky hastened to interpose; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pay
      attention to me. I shall be happier myself, when I am sure I am not in
      your way. And there&rsquo;s no need for you to entertain me; we old fellows have
      an occupation which you know nothing of yet, and which no amusement can
      replace&mdash;our memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young people listened to Lavretsky with polite but rather ironical
      respect&mdash;as though a teacher were giving them a lesson&mdash;and
      suddenly they all dispersed, and ran to the lawn; four stood near trees,
      one in the middle, and the game began.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lavretsky went back into the house, went into the dining-room, drew
      near the piano and touched one of the keys; it gave out a faint but clear
      sound; on that note had begun the inspired melody with which long ago on
      that same happy night Lemm, the dead Lemm, had thrown him into such
      transports. Then Lavretsky went into the drawing-room, and for a long time
      he did not leave it; in that room where he had so often seen Lisa, her
      image rose most vividly before him; he seemed to feel the traces of her
      presence round him; but his grief for her was crushing, not easy to bear;
      it had none of the peace which comes with death. Lisa still lived
      somewhere, hidden and afar; he thought of her as of the living, but he did
      not recognize the girl he had once loved in that dim pale shadow, cloaked
      in a nun&rsquo;s dress and encircled in misty clouds of incense. Lavretsky would
      not have recognized himself, could he have looked at himself, as mentally
      he looked at Lisa. In the course of these eight years he had passed that
      turning-point in life, which many never pass, but without which no one can
      be a good man to the end; he had really ceased to think of his own
      happiness, of his personal aims. He had grown calm, and&mdash;why hide the
      truth?&mdash;he had grown old not only in face and in body, he had grown
      old in heart; to keep a young heart up to old age, as some say, is not
      only difficult, but almost ridiculous; he may well be content who has not
      lost his belief in goodness, his steadfast will, and his zeal for work.
      Lavretsky had good reason to be content; he had become actually an
      excellent farmer, he had really learnt to cultivate the land, and his
      labours were not only for himself; he had, to the best of his powers,
      secured on a firm basis the welfare of his peasants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky went out of the house into the garden, and sat down on the
      familiar garden seat. And on this loved spot, facing the house where for
      the last time he had vainly stretched out his hand for the enchanted cup
      which frothed and sparkled with the golden wine of delight, he, a solitary
      homeless wanderer, looked back upon his life, while the joyous shouts of
      the younger generation who were already filling his place floated across
      the garden to him. His heart was sad, but not weighed down, nor bitter;
      much there was to regret, nothing to be ashamed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play away, be gay, grow strong, vigorous youth!&rdquo; he thought, and there
      was no bitterness in his meditations; &ldquo;your life is before you, and for
      you life will be easier; you have not, as we had, to find out a path for
      yourselves, to struggle, to fall, and to rise again in the dark; we had
      enough to do to last out&mdash;and how many of us did not last out?&mdash;but
      you need only do your duty, work away, and the blessing of an old man be
      with you. For me, after to-day, after these emotions, there remains to
      take my leave at last,&mdash;and though sadly, without envy, without any
      dark feelings, to say, in sight of the end, in sight of God who awaits me:
      &lsquo;Welcome, lonely old age! burn out, useless life!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavretsky quietly rose and quietly went away; no one noticed him, no one
      detained him; the joyous cries sounded more loudly in the garden behind
      the thick green wall of high lime-trees. He took his seat in the carriage
      and bade the coachman drive home and not hurry the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the end?&rdquo; perhaps the dissatisfied reader will inquire. &ldquo;What became
      of Lavretsky afterwards, and of Lisa?&rdquo; But what is there to tell of people
      who, though still alive, have withdrawn from the battlefield of life? They
      say, Lavretsky visited that remote convent where Lisa had hidden herself&mdash;that
      he saw her. Crossing over from choir to choir, she walked close past him,
      moving with the even, hurried, but meek walk of a nun; and she did not
      glance at him; only the eyelashes on the side towards him quivered a
      little, only she bent her emaciated face lower, and the fingers of her
      clasped hands, entwined with her rosary, were pressed still closer to one
      another. What were they both thinking, what were they feeling? Who can
      know? who can say? There are such moments in life, there are such
      feelings... One can but point to them&mdash;and pass them by.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
